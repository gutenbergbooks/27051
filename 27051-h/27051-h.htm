<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A WOMAN ON THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Many disquieting thoughts oppressed
Miss Sheila Langford as she halted
her pony on the crest of a slight rise
and swept the desolate and slumberous
world with an anxious glance. Quite the
most appalling of these thoughts developed
from a realization of the fact that she had
lost the trail. The whole categorical array
of inconveniences incidental to traveling in
a new, unsettled country paled into insignificance
when she considered this horrifying
and entirely unromantic fact. She was
lost; she had strayed from the trail, she was
alone and night was coming.</p>
<p>She would not have cared so much about
the darkness, for she had never been a coward,
and had conditions been normal she
would have asked nothing better than a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
rapid gallop over the dim plains. But as
she drew her pony up on the crest of the
rise a rumble of thunder reached her ears.
Of course it would rain, now that she had
lost the trail, she decided, yielding to a sudden,
bitter anger. It usually did rain when
one was abroad without prospect of shelter;
it always rained when one was lost.</p>
<p>Well, there was no help for it, of course,
and she had only herself to blame for the
blunder. For the other&mdash;not unusual&mdash;irritating
details that had combined to place her
in this awkward position she could blame,
first Duncan, the manager of the Double
R&mdash;who should have sent someone to meet
her at the station; the station agent&mdash;who
had allowed her to set forth in search of the
Double R without a guide,&mdash;though even
now, considering this phase of the situation,
she remembered that the agent had told her
there was no one to send&mdash;and certainly the
desolate appearance of Lazette had borne
out this statement; and last, she could blame
the country itself for being an unfeatured
wilderness.</p>
<p>Something might be said in extenuation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
of the station agent&#8217;s and the Double R
manager&#8217;s sins of omission, but without
doubt the country was what she had termed
it&mdash;an unfeatured wilderness. Her first
sensation upon getting a view of the country
had been one of deep disappointment.
There was plenty of it, she had decided,&mdash;enough
to make one shrink from its very
bigness; yet because it was different from
the land she had been accustomed to she felt
that somehow it was inferior. Her father
had assured her of its beauty, and she had
come prepared to fall in love with it, but
within the last half hour&mdash;when she had begun
to realize that she had lost the trail&mdash;she
had grown to hate it.</p>
<p>She hated the desolation, the space, the silence,
the arid stretches; she had made grimaces
at the &#8220;cactuses&#8221; with their forbidding
pricklers&mdash;though she could not help admiring
them, they seemed to be the only
growing thing in the country capable of defying
the heat and the sun. Most of all she
hated the alkali dust. All afternoon she had
kept brushing it off her clothing and clearing
it out of her throat, and only within the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
last half hour she had begun to realize that
her efforts had been without result&mdash;it lay
thick all over her; her throat was dry and
parched with it, and her eyes burned.</p>
<p>She sat erect, flushed and indignant, to
look around at the country. A premonitory
calm had succeeded the warning rumble.
Ominous black clouds were scurrying, wind-whipped,
spreading fan-like through the
sky, blotting out the colors of the sunset,
darkening the plains, creating weird shadows.
Objects that Sheila had been able to
see quite distinctly when she had reined in
her pony were no longer visible. She stirred
uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go somewhere,&#8221; she said aloud to
the pony, as she urged the animal down the
slope. &#8220;If it rains we&#8217;ll get just as wet
here as we would anywhere else.&#8221; She was
surprised at the queer quiver in her voice.
She was going to be brave, of course, but
somehow there seemed to be little consolation
in the logic of her remark.</p>
<p>The pony shambled forward, carefully
picking its way, and Sheila mentally thanked
the station agent for providing her with so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
reliable a beast. There was one consoling
fact at any rate, and she retracted many
hard things she had said in the early part of
her ride about the agent.</p>
<p>Shuffling down the slope the pony struck
a level. After traveling over this for a quarter
of an hour Sheila became aware of an
odd silence; looking upward she saw that
the clouds were no longer in motion; that
they were hovering, low and black, directly
overhead. A flash of lightning suddenly
illuminated the sky, showing Sheila a great
waste of world that stretched to four horizons.
It revealed, in the distance, the naked
peaks of some hills; a few frowning buttes
that seemed to fringe a river; some gullies in
which lurked forbidding shadows; clumps
of desert growth&mdash;the cactus&mdash;now seeming
grotesque and mocking; the snaky octilla;
the filmy, rustling mesquite; the dust-laden
sage-brush; the soap weed; the sentinel lance
of the yucca. Then the light was gone and
darkness came again.</p>
<p>Sheila shuddered and vainly tried to force
down a queer lump that had risen in her
throat over the desolation of it all. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
not anything like her father had pictured it!
Men had the silly habit of exaggerating in
these things, she decided&mdash;they were rough
themselves and they made the mistake of
thinking that great, grim things were attractive.
What beauty was there, for instance,
in a country where there was nothing
but space and silence and grotesque
weeds&mdash;and rain? Before she could answer
this question a sudden breeze swept over
her; a few large drops of rain dashed into
her face, and her thoughts returned to herself.</p>
<p>The pony broke into a sharp lope and she
allowed it to hold the pace, wisely concluding
that the animal was probably more familiar
with the country than she. She found
herself wondering why she had not thought
of that before&mdash;when, for example, a few
miles back she had deliberately guided it
out of a beaten trail toward a section of
country where, she had imagined, the traveling
would be better. No doubt she had
strayed from the trail just there.</p>
<p>The drops of rain grew more frequent;
they splashed into her face; she could feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
them striking her arms and shoulders. The
pony&#8217;s neck and mane became moist under
her hand, the darkness increased for a time
and the continuing rumble in the heavens
presaged a steady downpour.</p>
<p>The pony moved faster now; it needed no
urging, and Sheila held her breath for fear
that it might fall, straining her eyes to watch
its limbs as they moved with the sure regularity
of an automaton. After a time they
reached the end of the level; Sheila could
tell that the pony was negotiating another
rise, for it slackened speed appreciably and
she felt herself settling back against the
cantle of the saddle. A little later she realized
that they were going down the opposite
side of the rise, and a moment later they
were again on a level. A deeper blackness
than they had yet encountered rose on their
right, and Sheila correctly decided it to be
caused by a stretch of wood that she had observed
from the crest of the rise where she
had halted her pony for a view of the country.
After an interval, during which she debated
the wisdom of directing her pony into
the wood for protection from the rain which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
was now coming against her face in vicious
slants, her pony nickered shrilly!</p>
<p>A thrill of fear assailed Sheila. She knew
horses and was certain that some living thing
was on the trail in front of her. Halting
the pony, she held tightly to the reins
through a short, tense silence. Then presently,
from a point just ahead on the trail,
came an answering nicker in the horse language.
Sheila&#8217;s pony cavorted nervously
and broke into a lope, sharper this time in
spite of the tight rein she kept on it. Her
fear grew, though mingling with it was a
devout hope. If only the animal which had
answered her own pony belonged to the
Double R! She would take back many of
the unkind and uncharitable things she had
said about the country since she had lost
the trail.</p>
<p>The pony&#8217;s gait had quickened into a gallop&mdash;which
she could not check. In the past
few minutes the darkness had lifted a little;
she saw that the pony was making a gradual
turn, following a bend in the river. Then
came a flash of lightning and she saw, a
short distance ahead, a pony and rider, stationary,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
watching. With an effort she succeeded
in reining in her own animal, and
while she sat in the saddle, trembling and
anxious, there came another flash of lightning
and she saw the rider&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>The rider was a cowboy. She had distinctly
seen the leathern chaps on his legs;
the broad hat, the scarf at his throat. Doubt
and fear assailed her. What if the man did
not belong to the Double R? What if he
were a road agent&mdash;an outlaw? Immediately
she heard an exclamation from him in
which she detected much surprise and not a
little amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a slow movement. In the lifting
darkness Sheila saw the man return a
pistol to the holster that swung at his right
hip. He carelessly threw one leg over the
pommel of his saddle and looked at her. She
sat very rigid, debating a sudden impulse to
urge her pony past him and escape the danger
that seemed to threaten. While she
watched he shoved the broad brimmed hat
back from his forehead. He was not over
five feet distant from her; she could feel her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
pony nuzzling his with an inquisitive muzzle,
and she could dimly see the rider&#8217;s face. It
belonged to a man of probably twenty-eight
or thirty; it had regular features, keen, level
eyes and a firm mouth. There was a slight
smile on his face and somehow the fear that
had oppressed Sheila began to take flight.
And while she sat awaiting the turn of
events his voice again startled her:</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve stampeded off your
range, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sigh of relief escaped Sheila. The
voice was very gentle and friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that I have stampeded&mdash;whatever
that means,&#8221; she returned, reassured
now that the stranger gave promise of
being none of the dire figures of her imagination;
&#8220;I am lost merely. You see, I am
looking for the Double R ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said inexpressively; &#8220;the
Double R.&#8221;</p>
<p>There ensued a short silence and she could
not see his face for he had bowed his head
a little and the broad brimmed hat intervened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where the Double R ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
is?&#8221; There was a slight impatience in her
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; came his voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s up the
crick a ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; This information was disheartening.
Twenty miles! And the rain was
coming steadily down; she could feel it soaking
through her clothing. A bitter, unreasoning
anger against nature, against the circumstances
which had conspired to place her
in this position; against the man for his apparent
lack of interest in her welfare, moved
her, though she might have left the man out
of it, for certainly he could not be held responsible.
Yet his nonchalance, his serenity&mdash;something
about him&mdash;irritated her.
Didn&#8217;t he know she was getting wet? Why
didn&#8217;t he offer her shelter? It did not occur
to her that perhaps he knew of no shelter.
But while her indignation over his inaction
grew she saw that he was doing something&mdash;fumbling
at a bundle that seemed to be
strapped to the cantle of his saddle. And
then he leaned forward&mdash;very close to her&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
she saw that he was offering her a tarpaulin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrap yourself in this,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t pretty, of course, but it&#8217;ll keep you
from getting drenched. Rain ain&#8217;t no respecter
of persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>She detected a compliment in this but ignored
it and placed the tarpaulin around
her shoulders. Then it suddenly occurred
to her that he was without protection. She
hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t take
this. You haven&#8217;t anything for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>A careless laugh reached her. &#8220;That&#8217;s
all right; I don&#8217;t need anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence again. He broke it
with a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you figuring to do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>What was she going to do? The prospect
of a twenty-mile ride through a strange
country in a drenching rain was far from
appealing to her. Her hesitation was eloquent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she answered, no way
of escape from the dilemma presenting
itself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can go on, of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
get lost, or hurt&mdash;or killed. It&#8217;s a bad trail.
Or&#8221;&mdash;he continued, hesitating a little and
appearing to speak with an effort&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s
my shack. You can have that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he did have a dwelling place. This
voluntary information removed another of
the fearsome doubts that had beset her. She
had been afraid that he might prove to be
an irresponsible wanderer, but when a man
kept a house it gave to his character a certain
recommendation, it suggested stability,
more, it indicated honesty.</p>
<p>Of course she would have to accept the
shelter of his &#8220;shack.&#8221; There was no help
for it, for it was impossible for her to entertain
the idea of riding twenty miles over an
unknown trail, through the rain and darkness.
Moreover, she was not afraid of the
stranger now, for in spite of his easy, serene
movements, his quiet composure, his suppressed
amusement, Sheila detected a note
in his voice which told her that he was deeply
concerned over her welfare&mdash;even though
he seemed to be enjoying her. In any event
she could not go forward, for the unknown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
terrified her and she felt that in accepting
the proffered shelter of his &#8220;shack&#8221; she was
choosing the lesser of two dangers. She decided
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall accept&mdash;I think. Will you please
hurry? I am getting wet in spite of this&mdash;this
covering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wheeling without a word he proceeded
down the trail, following the river. The
darkness had abated somewhat, the low-hanging
clouds had taken on a grayish-white
hue, and the rain was coming down in
torrents. Sheila pulled the tarpaulin tighter
about her shoulders and clung desperately
to the saddle, listening to the whining of the
wind through the trees that flanked her,
keeping a watchful eye on the tall, swaying,
indistinct figure of her guide.</p>
<p>After riding for a quarter of an hour they
reached a little clearing near the river and
Sheila saw her guide halt his pony and dismount.
A squat, black shape loomed out of
the darkness near her and, riding closer, she
saw a small cabin, of the lean-to type, constructed
of adobe bricks. A dog barked in
front of her and she heard the stranger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
speak sharply to it. He silently approached
and helped her down from the saddle. Then
he led both horses away into the darkness on
the other side of the cabin. During his absence
she found time to glance about her.
It was a desolate place. Did he live here
alone?</p>
<p>The silence brought no answer to this
question, and while she continued to search
out objects in the darkness she saw the
stranger reappear around the corner of the
cabin and approach the door. He fumbled
at it for a moment and threw it open. He
disappeared within and an instant later
Sheila heard the scratch of a match and saw
a feeble glimmer of light shoot out through
the doorway. Then the stranger&#8217;s voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had lighted a candle that stood on a
table in the center of the room, and in its
glaring flicker as she stepped inside Sheila
caught her first good view of the stranger&#8217;s
face. She felt reassured instantly, for it
was a good face, with lines denoting strength
of character. The drooping mustache did
not quite conceal his lips, which were straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
and firm. Sheila was a little disturbed over
the hard expression in them, however,
though she had heard that the men of the
West lived rather hazardous lives and she
supposed that in time their faces showed it.
It was his eyes, though, that gave her a fleeting
glimpse of his character. They were
blue&mdash;a steely, fathomless blue; baffling,
mocking; swimming&mdash;as she looked into
them now&mdash;with an expression that she
could not attempt to analyze. One thing
she saw in them only,&mdash;recklessness&mdash;and
she drew a slow, deep breath.</p>
<p>They were standing very close together.
He caught the deep-drawn breath and
looked quickly at her, his eyes alight and
narrowed with an expression which was a
curious mingling of quizzical humor and
grim enjoyment. Her own eyes did not
waver, though his were boring into hers
steadily, as though he were trying to read
her thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221; he questioned, with a suggestion
of sarcasm in the curl of his lips.</p>
<p>Sheila stiffened, her eyes flashing defiance.
She studied him steadily, her spirit battling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his over the few feet that separated them.
Then she spoke deliberately, evenly: &#8220;I
am not afraid of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221; A gratified smile broke
on the straight, hard lips. A new expression
came into his eyes&mdash;admiration.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got nerve, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;m some
pleased that you&#8217;ve got that much trust in
me. You don&#8217;t need to be scared. You&#8217;re
as safe here as you&#8217;d be out there.&#8221; He
nodded toward the open door. &#8220;Safer,&#8221; he
added with a grave smile; &#8220;you might get
hurt out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned abruptly and went to the door,
where he stood for a long time looking out
into the darkness. She watched him for a
moment and then removed the tarpaulin and
hung it from a nail in the wall of the cabin.
Standing near the table she glanced about
her. There was only one room in the cabin,
but it was large&mdash;about twenty by twenty,
she estimated. Beside an open fireplace in a
corner were several pots and pans&mdash;his cooking
utensils. On a shelf were some dishes. A
guitar swung from a gaudy string suspended
from the wall. A tin of tobacco and a pipe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
reposed on another shelf beside a box of
matches. A bunk filled a corner and she
went over to it, fearing. But it was clean
and the bed clothing fresh and she smiled a
little as she continued her examination.</p>
<p>The latter finished she went to a small
window above the bunk, looking out into the
night. The rain came against the glass in
stinging slants, and watching it she found
herself feeling very grateful to the man who
stood in the doorway. Turning abruptly,
she caught him watching her, an appraising
smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be hungry by now,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a fireplace and some wood.
Do you want a fire?&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to her nod he kindled a fire,
she standing beside the window watching
him, noting his lithe, easy movements. She
could not mistake the strength and virility
of his figure, even with his back turned to
her, but it seemed to her that there was a
certain recklessness in his actions&mdash;as though
his every movement advertised a careless regard
for consequences. She held her breath
when he split a short log into slender splinters,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
for he swung the short-handled axe
with a loose grasp, as though he cared very
little where its sharp blade landed. But she
noted that he struck with precision despite
his apparent carelessness, every blow falling
true. His manner of handling the axe reflected
the spirit that shone in his eyes when,
after kindling the fire, he stood up and
looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s grub in the chuck box,&#8221; he
stated shortly. &#8220;There&#8217;s some pans and
things. It ain&#8217;t what you might call elegant&mdash;not
what you&#8217;ve been used to, I expect.
But it&#8217;s a heap better than nothing, and I
reckon you&#8217;ll be able to get along.&#8221; He
turned and walked to the doorway, standing
in it for an instant, facing out. &#8220;Good-night,&#8221;
he added. The tarpaulin dangled
from his arm.</p>
<p>Evidently he intended going away. A
sudden dread of being alone filled her.
&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she cried involuntarily. &#8220;Where
are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>He halted and looked back at her, an odd
smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;To my bunk.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She could not analyze the smile
on his face, but in it she thought she detected
something subtle&mdash;untruthfulness perhaps.
She glanced at the tarpaulin and from it to
his eyes, holding her gaze steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to sleep in the open,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>He caught the accusation in her eyes and
his face reddened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said, a little doubtfully.
&#8220;But I do not care to feel that I am driving
you out into the storm. You might catch
cold and die. And I should not want to
think that I was responsible for your death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little wetting wouldn&#8217;t hurt me.&#8221; He
looked at her appraisingly, a glint of sympathy
in his eyes. Standing there, framed
in the darkness, the flickering light from the
candle on his strong, grave face, he made a
picture that, she felt, she would not soon
forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you ain&#8217;t afraid to stay here
alone, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she returned frankly, &#8220;I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
afraid. I do not want to stay here alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pistol flashed in his hand, its butt toward
her, and now for the first time she saw
another at his hip. She repressed a desire
to shudder and stared with dilated eyes at
the extended weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this gun,&#8221; he offered. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t
much for looks, but it&#8217;ll go right handy.
You can bar the door, too, and the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>She refused to take the weapon. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t know how to use it if I had occasion
to. I prefer to have you remain in the
cabin&mdash;for protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed. &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221; he began,
and then smiled wryly. &#8220;It certainly
would be some wet outside,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be pleasant sleeping. I&#8217;ll lay
over here by the door when I get my blankets.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went outside and in a few minutes reappeared
with his blankets and saddle.
Without speaking a word to Sheila he laid
the saddle down, spread the blanket over it,
and stretched himself out on his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about the light,&#8221; he said
after an interval of silence, during which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Sheila sat on the edge of the bunk and regarded
his profile appraisingly. &#8220;You can
blow it out if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer to have it burning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suit yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila got up and placed the candle in a
tin dish as a precaution against fire. Then,
when its position satisfied her she left the
table and went to the bunk, stretching herself
out on it, fully dressed.</p>
<p>For a long time she lay, listening to the
soft patter of the rain on the roof, looking
upward at the drops that splashed against
the window, listening to the fitful whining
of the wind through the trees near the cabin.
Her eyes closed presently, sleep was fast
claiming her. Then she heard her host&#8217;s
voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re from the East, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;City?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Albany.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence. Sheila was thoroughly
awake again, and once more her gaze
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
went to the window, where unceasing
streams trickled down the glass. Whatever
fear she had had of the owner of the cabin
had long ago been dispelled by his manner
which, though puzzling, hinted of the gentleman.
She would have liked him better
were it not for the reckless gleam in his eyes;
that gleam, it seemed to her, indicated a
trait of character which was not wholly admirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you come out here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila smiled at the rain-spattered window,
a flash of pleased vanity in her eyes.
His voice had been low, but in it she detected
much curiosity, even interest. It was not
surprising, of course, that he should feel an
interest in her; other men had been interested
in her too, only they had not been men
that lived in romantic wildernesses,&mdash;observe
that she did not make use of the term
&#8220;unfeatured,&#8221; which she had manufactured
soon after realizing that she was lost&mdash;nor
had they carried big revolvers, like this man,
who seemed also to know very well how to
use them.</p>
<p>Those other men who had been interested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
in her had had a way of looking at her; there
had always been a significant boldness in
their eyes which belied the gentleness of demeanor
which, she had always been sure,
merely masked their real characters. She
had never been able to look squarely at any
of those men, the men of her circle who had
danced attendance upon her at the social
functions that had formerly filled her existence&mdash;without
a feeling of repugnance.</p>
<p>They had worn man-shapes, of course,
but somehow they had seemed to lack something
real and vital; seemed to have possessed
nothing of that forceful, magnetic
personality which was needed to arouse her
sympathy and interest. Not that the man
on the floor in front of the door interested
her&mdash;she could not admit that! But she had
felt a sympathy for him in his loneliness,
and she had looked into his eyes&mdash;had been
able to look steadily into them, and though
she had seen expressions that had puzzled
her, she had at least seen nothing to cause
her to feel any uneasiness. She had seen
manliness there, and indomitability, and
force, and it had seemed to her to be sufficient.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
His would be an ideal face were it
not for the expression that lingered about
the lips, were it not for the reckless glint in
his eyes&mdash;a glint that revealed an untamed
spirit.</p>
<p>His question remained unanswered. He
stirred impatiently, and glancing at him
Sheila saw that he had raised himself so
that his chin rested in his hand, his elbow
supported by the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You here for a visit?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I do not know
how long I shall stay. My father has bought
the Double R.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time it seemed that he would
have no comment to make on this and
Sheila&#8217;s lips took on a decidedly petulant
expression. Apparently he was not interested
in her after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Duncan has sold out?&#8221; There
was satisfaction in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are keen,&#8221; she mocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And tickled,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>His short laugh brought a sudden interest
into her eyes. &#8220;Then you don&#8217;t like Duncan,&#8221;
she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re some keen too,&#8221; came
the mocking response.</p>
<p>Sheila flushed, turned and looked defiantly
at him. His hand still supported his head
and there was an unmistakable interest in
his eyes as he caught her glance at him and
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got any objections to telling me
your name? We ain&#8217;t been introduced, you
know?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Sheila Langford.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had turned her head and was giving
her attention to the window above her. The
fingers of the hand that had been supporting
his head slowly clenched, he raised himself
slightly, his body rigid, his chin thrusting,
his face pale, his eyes burning with a
sudden fierce fire. Once he opened his lips
to speak, but instantly closed them again,
and a smile wreathed them&mdash;a mirthless
smile that had in it a certain cold caution
and cunning. After a silence that lasted
long his voice came again, drawling, well-controlled,
revealing nothing of the emotion
which had previously affected him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your father&#8217;s name?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;David Dowd Langford. An uncommon
middle name, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Uncommon,&#8221; came his reply. His
face, with the light of the candle gleaming
full upon it, bore a queer pallor&mdash;the white
of cold ashes. His right hand, which had
been resting carelessly on the blanket, was
now gripping it, the muscles tense and knotted.
Yet after another long silence his voice
came again&mdash;drawling, well-controlled, as
before:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is he coming out here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has retired from business and is coming
out here for his health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What business was he in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wholesale hardware.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was silent again and presently, hearing
him stir, Sheila looked covertly at him.
He had turned, his back was toward her,
and he was stretched out on the blanket as
though, fully satisfied with the result of his
questioning, he intended going to sleep. For
several minutes Sheila watched him with a
growing curiosity. It was like a man to ask
all and give nothing. He had questioned
her to his complete satisfaction but had told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
nothing of himself. She was determined to
discover something about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota?&#8221; she repeated, puzzled. &#8220;That
isn&#8217;t a name; it&#8217;s a State&mdash;or a Territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Dakota. Ask anybody.&#8221; There
was a decided drawl in his voice.</p>
<p>This information was far from being satisfactory,
but she supposed it must answer.
Still, she persisted. &#8220;Where are you
from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seemed to end it. It had been a
short quest and an unsatisfactory one. It
was perfectly plain to her that he was some
sort of a rancher&mdash;at the least a cowboy. It
was also plain that he had been a cowboy before
coming to this section of the country&mdash;probably
in Dakota. She was perplexed
and vexed and nibbled impatiently at her
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota isn&#8217;t your real name,&#8221; she declared
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; There came the drawl again.
It irritated her this time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s as good as any other. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila did not answer. Five minutes later
she was asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE DIM TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Sheila had been dreaming of a world
in which there was nothing but rain
and mud and clouds and reckless-eyed
individuals who conversed in irritating
drawls when a sharp crash of thunder
awakened her. During her sleep she had
turned her face to the wall, and when her
eyes opened the first thing that her gaze
rested on was the small window above her
head. She regarded it for some time, following
with her eyes the erratic streams
that trickled down the glass, stretching out
wearily, listening to the wind. It was cold
and bleak outside and she had much to be
thankful for.</p>
<p>She was glad that she had not allowed the
mysterious inhabitant of the cabin to sleep
out in his tarpaulin, for the howling of the
wind brought weird thoughts into her mind;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
she reflected upon her helplessness and it
was extremely satisfying to know that within
ten feet of her lay a man whose two big revolvers&mdash;even
though she feared them&mdash;seemed
to insure protection. It was odd,
she told herself, that she should place so
much confidence in Dakota, and her presence
in the cabin with him was certainly a
breach of propriety which&mdash;were her friends
in the East to hear of it&mdash;would arouse much
comment&mdash;entirely unfavorable to her. Yes,
it was odd, yet considering Dakota, she was
not in the least disturbed. So far his conduct
toward her had been that of the perfect
gentleman, and in spite of the recklessness
that gleamed in his eyes whenever he looked
at her she was certain that he would continue
to be a gentleman.</p>
<p>It was restful to lie and listen to the rain
splashing on the roof and against the window,
but sleep, for some unaccountable reason,
seemed to grow farther from her&mdash;the
recollection of events during the past few
hours left no room in her thoughts for sleep.
Turning, after a while, to seek a more comfortable
position, she saw Dakota sitting at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the table, on the side opposite her, watching
her intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t sleep, eh?&#8221; he said, when he saw
her looking at him. &#8220;Storm bother you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was the thunder that awakened
me,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;Thunder always
does. Evidently it disturbs you too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been asleep,&#8221; he said in a curt
tone.</p>
<p>He continued to watch her with a quiet,
appraising gaze. It was evident that he
had been thinking of her when she had
turned to look at him. She flushed with embarrassment
over the thought that while she
had been asleep he must have been considering
her, and yet, looking closely at him now,
she decided that his expression was frankly
impersonal.</p>
<p>He glanced at his watch. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been
asleep two hours,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
watching you&mdash;and envying you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Envying me? Why? Are you troubled
with insomnia?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;Nothing so serious as that.
It&#8217;s just thoughts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleasant ones, of course.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You might call them pleasant. I&#8217;ve
been thinking of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila found no reply to make to this, but
blushed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking of you,&#8221; repeated Dakota.
&#8220;Of the chance you took in coming out here
alone&mdash;in coming into my shack. We&#8217;re
twenty miles from town here&mdash;twenty miles
from the Double R&mdash;the nearest ranch. It
isn&#8217;t likely that a soul will pass here for a
month. Suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t &#8216;suppose,&#8217; if you please,&#8221; said
Sheila. Her face had grown slowly pale,
but there was a confident smile on her lips
as she looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he said, watching her steadily.
&#8220;Why? Isn&#8217;t it quite possible that you
could have fallen in with a sort of man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens, I did not,&#8221; interrupted
Sheila.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s gaze met his unwaveringly. &#8220;Because
you are the man,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>
<p>She thought she saw a glint of pleasure
in his eyes, but was not quite certain, for his
expression changed instantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fate, or Providence&mdash;or whatever you
are pleased to call the power that shuffles us
flesh and blood mannikins around&mdash;has a
way of putting us all in the right places. I
expect that&#8217;s one of the reasons why you
didn&#8217;t fall in with the sort of man I was going
to tell you about,&#8221; said Dakota.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what Fate has to do&mdash;&#8221; began
Sheila, wondering at his serious tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he drawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is odd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you don&#8217;t see. But lots of people
don&#8217;t see. They&#8217;re chucked and shoved
around like men on a chess board, and
though they&#8217;re always interested they don&#8217;t
usually know what it&#8217;s all about. Just as
well too&mdash;usually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled mysteriously. &#8220;Did I say
that I expected you to see?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything personal in this, aside
from the fact that I was trying to show you
that some one was foolish in sending you out
here alone. Some day you&#8217;ll look back on
your visit here and then you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up and walked to the door, opening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
it and standing there looking out into
the darkness. Sheila watched him, puzzled
by his mysterious manner, though not in the
least afraid of him. Several times while
he stood at the door he turned and looked at
her and presently, when a gust of wind
rushed in and Sheila shivered, he abruptly
closed the door, barred it, and strode to the
fireplace, throwing a fresh log into it. For
a time he stood silently in front of the fire,
his figure casting a long, gaunt shadow at
Sheila&#8217;s feet, his gaze on her, grim, somber
lines in his face. Presently he cleared his
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve lived East all your life.
Lived well, too, I suppose&mdash;plenty of
money, luxuries, happiness?&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught her nod and continued, his lips
curling a little. &#8220;Your father too, I
reckon&mdash;has he been happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s odd.&#8221; He had spoken more to
himself than to Sheila and he looked at her
with narrowed eyes when she answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is odd? That my father should
be happy&mdash;that I should?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd that anyone who is happy in one
place should want to leave that place and
go to another. Maybe the place he went
to wouldn&#8217;t be just right for him. What
makes people want to move around like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you could answer that yourself,&#8221;
suggested Sheila. &#8220;I am sure that
you haven&#8217;t lived here in this part of the
country all your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; His gaze
was quizzical and mocking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But you haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll say I haven&#8217;t. But
I wasn&#8217;t happy where I came from and I
came here looking for happiness&mdash;and something
else. That I didn&#8217;t find what I was
looking for isn&#8217;t the question&mdash;mostly none
of us find the things we&#8217;re looking for. But
if I had been happy where I was I wouldn&#8217;t
have come here. You say your father has
been happy there; that he&#8217;s got plenty of
money and all that. Then why should he
want to live here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I told you that he is coming
here for his health.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes lighted savagely. But Sheila
did not catch their expression for at that
moment she was looking at his shadow on
the floor. How long, how grotesque, it
seemed, and forbidding&mdash;like its owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;s got everything he wants but his
health. What made him lose that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just lost it, I reckon,&#8221; said Dakota
subtly. &#8220;Cares and Worry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume. His health has been failing
for about ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila was looking straight at Dakota
now and she saw his face whiten, his lips
harden. And when he spoke again there
was a chill in his voice and a distinct pause
between his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a long
time, isn&#8217;t it? A long time for a man who
has been losing his health. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
There was a mirthless smile on Dakota&#8217;s
face&mdash;&#8220;ten years is a longer time for a man
in good health who hasn&#8217;t been happy.
Couldn&#8217;t your father have doctored&mdash;gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
abroad&mdash;to recover his health? Or was his
a mental sickness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mental, I think. He worried quite a
little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota turned from her, but not quickly
enough to conceal the light of savage joy
that flashed suddenly into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Sheila, voicing her
surprise at the startling change in his manner;
&#8220;that seems to please you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does.&#8221; He laughed oddly. &#8220;It
pleases me to find that I&#8217;m to have a neighbor
who is afflicted with the sort of sickness
that has been bothering me for&mdash;for a good
many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence, during which Sheila
yawned and Dakota stood motionless, looking
straight ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like your father, I reckon?&#8221; came
his voice presently, as his gaze went to her
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221; She looked up at him in
surprise. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I like him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you like him. Mostly children
like their fathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Children!&#8221; She glared scornfully at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
him. &#8220;I am twenty-two! I told you that
before!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you did,&#8221; he returned, unruffled.
&#8220;When is he coming out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a month&mdash;a month from to-day.&#8221;
She regarded him with a sudden, new interest.
&#8220;You are betraying a great deal of
curiosity,&#8221; she accused. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;I reckon
that isn&#8217;t odd, is it? He&#8217;s going to be my
neighbor, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said with emphasis of mockery
which equalled his. &#8220;And you are gossiping
about your neighbor even before he
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a woman,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;An impertinent one,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father,&#8221; he said in accents of sarcasm,
ignoring the jibe, &#8220;seems to think a
heap of you&mdash;sending you all the way out
here alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came against his wish; he wanted me
to wait and come with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her defense of her parent seemed to
amuse him. He smiled mysteriously.
&#8220;Then he likes you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is that strange? He hasn&#8217;t any one
else&mdash;no relative. I am the only one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one.&#8221; He repeated
her words slowly, regarding her narrowly.
&#8220;And he likes you. I reckon he&#8217;d be hurt
quite a little if you had fallen in with the
sort of man I was going to tell you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221; Sheila was tapping with
her booted foot on his shadow on the floor
and did not look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious thing,&#8221; he said slowly, after
an interval, &#8220;that a man who has got a
treasure grows careless of it in time. It&#8217;s
natural, too. But I reckon fate has something
to do with it. Ten chances to one if
nothing happens to you your father will consider
himself lucky. But suppose you had
happened to fall in with a different man
than me&mdash;we&#8217;ll say, for instance, a man who
had a grudge against your father&mdash;and that
man didn&#8217;t have that uncommon quality
called &#8216;mercy.&#8217; What then? Ten chances
to one your father would say it was fate that
had led you to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said scornfully, &#8220;that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
are talking silly! In the first place, I don&#8217;t
believe my father thinks that I am a treasure,
though he likes me very much. In the
second place, if he does think that I am a
treasure, he is very much mistaken, for I am
not&mdash;I am a woman and quite able to take
care of myself. You have exhibited a wonderful
curiosity over my father and me, and
though it has all been mystifying and entertaining,
I don&#8217;t purpose to talk to you
all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t waken you,&#8221; he mocked.</p>
<p>Sheila swung around on the bunk, her
back to him. &#8220;You are keeping me awake,&#8221;
she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good night then,&#8221; he laughed,
&#8220;Miss Sheila.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Dakota,&#8221; she returned.</p>
<p>Sheila did not hear him again. Her
thoughts dwelt for a little time on him and
his mysterious manner, then they strayed.
They returned presently and she concentrated
her attention on the rain; she could
hear the soft, steady patter of it on the roof;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
she listened to it trickling from the eaves and
striking the glass in the window above her
head. Gradually the soft patter seemed to
draw farther away, became faint, and more
faint, and finally she heard it no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>CONVERGING TRAILS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the barking of a dog that brought
Sheila out of a sleep&mdash;dreamless this
time&mdash;into a state of semi-consciousness.
It was Dakota&#8217;s dog surely, she decided
sleepily. She sighed and twisted to a more
comfortable position. The effort awakened
her and she opened her eyes, her gaze resting
immediately on Dakota. He still sat at
the table, silent, immovable, as before. But
now he was sitting erect, his muscles tensed,
his chin thrust out aggressively, his gaze on
the door&mdash;listening. He seemed to be unaware
of Sheila&#8217;s presence; the sound that
she had made in turning he apparently had
not heard.</p>
<p>There was an interval of silence and then
came a knocking on the door&mdash;loud, unmistakable.
Some one desired admittance.
After the knock came a voice:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello inside!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello yourself!&#8221; Dakota&#8217;s voice came
with a truculent snap. &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lookin&#8217; for a dry place,&#8221; came the voice
from without. &#8220;Mebbe you don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s
wet out here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s gaze was riveted on Dakota. He
arose and noiselessly moved his chair back
from the table and she saw a saturnine smile
on his face, yet in his eyes there shone a
glint of intolerance that mingled oddly with
his gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You alone?&#8221; he questioned, his gaze on
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Campbellite preacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time since she had been
awake Dakota turned and looked at Sheila.
The expression of his face puzzled her. &#8220;A
parson!&#8221; he sneered in a low voice. &#8220;I
reckon we&#8217;ll have some praying now.&#8221; He
took a step forward, hesitated, and looked
back at Sheila. &#8220;Do you want him in
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s nod brought a whimsical, shallow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
smile to his face. &#8220;Of course you do&mdash;you&#8217;re
lonesome in here.&#8221; There was
mockery in his voice. He deliberately
drew out his two guns, examined them minutely,
returned one to his holster, retaining
the other in his right hand. With a cold
grin at Sheila he snuffed out the candle between
a finger and a thumb and strode to
the door&mdash;Sheila could hear him fumbling
at the fastenings. He spoke to the man outside
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a movement; a square of light
appeared in the wall of darkness; there
came a step on the threshold. Watching,
Sheila saw, framed in the open doorway, the
dim outlines of a figure&mdash;a man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand right there,&#8221; came Dakota&#8217;s voice
from somewhere in the impenetrable darkness
of the interior, and Sheila wondered at
the hospitality that greeted a stranger with
total darkness and a revolver. &#8220;Light a
match.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a short interval of silence there
came the sound of a match scratching on
the wall, and a light flared up, showing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Sheila the face of a man of sixty, bronzed,
bearded, with gentle, quizzical eyes.</p>
<p>The light died down, the man waited.
Sheila had forgotten&mdash;in her desire to see
the face of the visitor&mdash;to look for Dakota,
but presently she heard his voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re a parson, all right.
Close the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parson obeyed the command. &#8220;Light
the candle on the table!&#8221; came the order
from Dakota. &#8220;I&#8217;m not taking any
chances until I get a better look at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another match flared up and the parson
advanced to the table and lighted the candle.
He smiled while applying the match to the
wick. &#8220;Don&#8217;t pay to take no chances&mdash;on
anything,&#8221; he agreed. He stood erect, a
tall man, rugged and active for his sixty
years, and threw off a rain-soaked tarpaulin.
Some traces of dampness were visible
on his clothing, but in the circumstances he
had not fared so badly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a new trail to me&mdash;I don&#8217;t know the
country,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t seen
your light I reckon I&#8217;d have been goin&#8217; yet.
I was thinkin&#8217; that it was mighty queer that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
you&#8217;d have a light goin&#8217; so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
stopped short, seeing Sheila sitting on the
bunk. &#8220;Shucks, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he apologized,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were there.&#8221; His hat
came off and dangled in his left hand; with
the other he brushed back the hair from his
forehead, smiling meanwhile at Sheila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said apologetically,
&#8220;if your husband had told me you was here
I&#8217;d have gone right on an&#8217; not bothered
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s gaze went from the parson&#8217;s face
and sought Dakota&#8217;s, a crimson flood
spreading over her face and temples. A
slow, amused gleam filled Dakota&#8217;s eyes.
But plainly he did not intend to set the parson
right&mdash;he was enjoying Sheila&#8217;s confusion.
The color fled from her face as suddenly
as it had come and was succeeded by
the pallor of a cold indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not married,&#8221; she said instantly to
the parson; &#8220;this gentleman is not my husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not?&#8221; questioned the parson. &#8220;Then
how&mdash;&#8221; He hesitated and looked quickly
at Dakota, but the latter was watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
Sheila with an odd smile and the parson
looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my first day in this country,&#8221;
explained Sheila.</p>
<p>The parson did not reply to this, though
he continued to watch her intently. She
met his gaze steadily and he smiled. &#8220;I
reckon you&#8217;ve been caught on the trail too,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;by the storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s been right wet to-night, an&#8217; it
ain&#8217;t no night to be galivantin&#8217; around the
country. Where you goin&#8217; to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Double R ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Double R?&#8221; asked the parson.</p>
<p>&#8220;West,&#8221; Dakota answered for Sheila;
&#8220;twenty miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Off my trail,&#8221; said the parson. &#8220;I&#8217;m
travelin&#8217; to Lazette.&#8221; He laughed, shortly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m askin&#8217; your pardon, ma&#8217;am, for takin&#8217;
you to be married; you don&#8217;t look like you
belonged here&mdash;I ought to have knowed
that right off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila told him that he was forgiven and
he had no comment to make on this, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
looked at her appraisingly. He drew a
bench up near the fire and sat looking at
the licking flames, the heat drawing the
steam from his clothing as the latter dried.
Dakota supplied him with soda biscuit and
cold bacon, and these he munched in contentment,
talking meanwhile of his travels. Several
times while he sat before the fire Dakota
spoke to him, and finally he pulled his
chair over near the wall opposite the bunk
on which Sheila sat, tilted it back, and
dropped into it, stretching out comfortably.</p>
<p>After seating himself, Dakota&#8217;s gaze
sought Sheila. It was evident to Sheila that
he was thinking pleasant thoughts, for several
times she looked quickly at him to catch
him smiling. Once she met his gaze fairly
and was certain that she saw a crafty, calculating
gleam in his eyes. She was puzzled,
though there was nothing of fear from Dakota
now; the presence of the parson in the
cabin assured her of safety.</p>
<p>A half hour dragged by. The parson
did not appear to be sleepy. Sheila glanced
at her watch and saw that it was midnight.
She wondered much at the parson&#8217;s wakefulness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
and her own weariness. But she
could safely go to sleep now, she told herself,
and she stretched noiselessly out on the
bunk and with one arm bent under her head
listened to the parson.</p>
<p>Evidently the parson was itinerant; he
spoke of many places&mdash;Wyoming, Colorado,
Nevada, Arizona, Texas; of towns in
New Mexico. To Sheila, her senses dulled
by the drowsiness that was stealing over her,
it appeared that the parson was a foe to
Science. His volubility filled the cabin; he
contended sonorously that the earth was not
round. The Scriptures, he maintained,
held otherwise. He called Dakota&#8217;s attention
to the seventh chapter of Revelation,
verse one:</p>
<p>&#8220;And after these things I saw four angels
standing on the four corners of the
earth, holding the four winds of the earth,
that the wind should not blow on the earth,
nor on the sea, nor on any tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several times Sheila heard Dakota laugh,
mockingly; he was skeptical, caustic even,
and he took issue with the parson. Between
them they managed to prevent her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
falling asleep; kept her in a semidoze which
was very near to complete wakefulness.</p>
<p>After a time, though, the argument grew
monotonous; the droning of their voices
seemed gradually to grow distant; Sheila
lost interest in the conversation and sank
deeper into her doze. How long she had
been unconscious of them she did not know,
but presently she was awake again and listening.
Dakota&#8217;s laugh had awakened her.
Out of the corners of her eyes she saw that
he was still seated in the chair beside the
wall and that his eyes were alight with interest
as he watched the parson.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re going to Lazette, taking it on
to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The parson nodded, smiling. &#8220;When a
man wants to get married he&#8217;ll not care
much about the arrangements&mdash;how it gets
done. What he wants to do is to get married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a queer angle,&#8221; Dakota observed.
He laughed immoderately.</p>
<p>The parson laughed with him. It <i>was</i> an
odd situation, he agreed. Never, in all his
experience, had he heard of anything like it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>He had stopped for a few hours at Dry
Bottom. While there a rider had passed
through, carrying word that a certain man
in Lazette, called &#8220;Baldy,&#8221; desired to get
married. There was no minister in Lazette,
not even a justice of the peace. But Baldy
wanted to be married, and his bride-to-be
objected to making the trip to Dry Bottom,
where there were both a parson and a justice
of the peace. Therefore, failing to induce
the lady to go to the parson, it followed that
Baldy must contrive to have the parson
come to the lady. He dispatched the rider
to Dry Bottom on this quest.</p>
<p>The rider had found that there was no
regular parson in Dry Bottom and that the
justice of the peace had departed the day
before to some distant town for a visit.
Luckily for Baldy&#8217;s matrimonial plans, the
parson had been in Dry Bottom when the
rider arrived, and he readily consented&mdash;as
he intended to pass through Lazette anyway&mdash;to
carry Baldy&#8217;s license to him and perform
the ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; remarked the parson,
after he had concluded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a queer angle,&#8221; repeated Dakota.
&#8220;You got the license?&#8221; he inquired softly.
&#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;ve lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon not.&#8221; The parson fumbled in
a pocket, drawing out a folded paper. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got it, right enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got no objections to me looking
at it?&#8221; came Dakota&#8217;s voice. Sheila saw
him rise. There was a strange smile on his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No objections. I reckon you&#8217;ll be usin&#8217;
one yourself one of these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these days,&#8221; echoed Dakota with
a laugh as strange as his smile a moment before.
&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&#8217;m thinking of using one
one of these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parson spread the paper out on the
table. Together he and Dakota bent their
heads over it. After reading the license Dakota
stood erect. He laughed, looking at
the parson.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a name on it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not
a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re reckonin&#8217; to fill in the names
when they&#8217;re married,&#8221; explained the parson.
&#8220;That there rider ought to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
knowed the names, but he didn&#8217;t. Only
knowed that the man was called &#8216;Baldy.&#8217;
Didn&#8217;t know the bride&#8217;s name at all. But it
don&#8217;t make any difference; they wouldn&#8217;t
have had to have a license at all in this Territory.
But it makes it look more regular
when they&#8217;ve got one. All that&#8217;s got to be
done is for Baldy to go over to Dry Bottom
an&#8217; have the names recorded. Bein&#8217; as I
can&#8217;t go, I&#8217;m to certify in the license.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Dakota slowly. &#8220;It makes
things more regular to have a license&mdash;more
regular to have you certify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at Dakota, Sheila thought she
saw in his face a certain preoccupation; he
was evidently not thinking of what he was
saying at all; the words had come involuntarily,
automatically almost, it seemed, so
inexpressive were they. &#8220;Sure,&#8221; he repeated,
&#8220;you&#8217;re to certify, in the license.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was as though he were reading aloud
from a printed page, his thoughts elsewhere,
and seeing only the words and uttering them
unconsciously. Some idea had formed in his
brain, he meditated some surprising action.
That she was concerned in his thoughts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Sheila did not doubt, for he presently turned
and looked straight at her and in his eyes she
saw a new expression&mdash;a cold, designing
gleam that frightened her.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, when the parson announced
his intention to care for his horse
before retiring and stood in the doorway
preparatory to going out, Sheila restrained
an impulse to call to him to remain. She
succeeded in quieting her fears, however, by
assuring herself that nothing could happen
now, with the parson so near. Thus fortified,
she smiled at Dakota as the parson
stepped down and closed the door.</p>
<p>She drew a startled breath in the next instant,
though, for without noticing her smile
Dakota stepped to the door and barred it.
Turning, he stood with his back against it,
his lips in straight, hard lines, his eyes steady
and gleaming brightly.</p>
<p>He caught Sheila&#8217;s gaze and held it; she
trembled and sat erect.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s odd, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, in the mocking
voice that he had used when using the
same words earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is odd?&#8221; Hers was the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
answer that she had used before, too&mdash;she
could think of nothing else to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd that he should come along just at
this time.&#8221; He indicated the door through
which the parson had disappeared. &#8220;You
and me are here, and he comes. Who sent
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chance, I suppose,&#8221; Sheila answered,
though she could feel that there was a subtle
undercurrent in his speech, and she felt
again the strange unrest that had affected
her several times before.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it was chance,&#8221; he said, drawling
his words. &#8220;Well, maybe that&#8217;s just as
good a name for it as any other. But we
don&#8217;t all see things the same way, do we?
We couldn&#8217;t, of course, because we&#8217;ve all
got different things to do. We think this is
a big world and that we play a big game.
But it&#8217;s a little world and a little game when
Fate takes a hand in it. I told you a while
ago that Fate had a queer way of shuffling
us around. That&#8217;s a fact. And Fate is
running this game.&#8221; His mocking laugh
had a note of grimness in it, which brought
a chill over Sheila. &#8220;Just now, Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Sheila, Fate is playing with brides and
bridegrooms and marriages and parsons.
That&#8217;s what is so odd. Fate has supplied
the parson and the license; we&#8217;ll supply the
names. Look at the bridegroom, Sheila,&#8221;
he directed, tapping his breast with a finger;
&#8220;this is your wedding day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Sheila was on her
feet, trembling, her face white with fear and
dread.</p>
<p>&#8220;That we&#8217;re to be married,&#8221; he said, smiling
at her, and she noted with a qualm that
there was no mirth in the smile, &#8220;you and
me. The parson will tie the knot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a joke, I suppose?&#8221; she said
scornfully, attempting a lightness that she
did not feel; &#8220;a crude one, to be sure, for
you certainly cannot be serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never more serious in my life,&#8221;
he said slowly. &#8220;We are to be married
when the parson comes in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you purpose to accomplish
this?&#8221; she jeered. &#8220;The parson certainly
will not perform a marriage ceremony without
the consent of&mdash;without my consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said coldly, &#8220;that you will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
consent. I am not in a trifling mood. Just
now it pleases me to imagine that I am an
instrument of Fate. Maybe that sounds
mysterious to you, but some day you will be
able to see just how logical it all seems to me
now, that Fate has sent me a pawn&mdash;a subject,
if you please&mdash;to sacrifice, that the
game which I have been playing may be carried
to its conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside they heard the dog bark, heard
the parson speak to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The parson is coming,&#8221; said Sheila, her
joy over the impending interruption showing
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is coming.&#8221; Still with his back
to the door, Dakota deliberately drew out
one of his heavy pistols and examined it minutely,
paying no attention to Sheila. Her
eyes widened with fear as the hand holding
the weapon dropped to his side and he
looked at her again.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing to do?&#8221; she demanded,
watching these forbidding preparations
with dilated eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; he returned with a
chilling laugh. &#8220;Have you ever seen a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
man die? No?&#8221; he continued as she shuddered.
&#8220;Well, if you don&#8217;t consent to
marry me you will see the parson die. I
have decided to give you the choice, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he went on in a quiet, determined voice, entirely
free from emotion. &#8220;Sacrifice yourself
and the parson lives; refuse and I shoot
the parson down the instant he steps inside
the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried in horror, taking a step
toward him and looking into his eyes for evidence
of insincerity&mdash;for the slightest sign
that would tell her that he was merely trying
to scare her. &#8220;Oh! you&mdash;you coward!&#8221;
she cried, for she saw nothing in his eyes but
cold resolution.</p>
<p>He smiled with straight lips. &#8220;You
see,&#8221; he mocked, &#8220;how odd it is? Fate is
shuffling us three in this game. You have
your choice. Do you care to be responsible
for the death of a fellow being?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a tense instant she looked at him,
and seeing the hard, inexorable glitter in his
eyes she cringed away from him and sank to
the edge of the bunk, covering her face with
her hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>During the silence that followed she
could hear the parson outside&mdash;his voice, and
the yelping of the dog&mdash;evidently they had
formed a friendship. The sounds came
nearer; Sheila heard the parson try the door.
She became aware that Dakota was standing
over her and she looked up, shivering,
to see his face, still hard and unyielding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to open the door,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Is it you or the parson?&#8221;</p>
<p>At that word she was on her feet, standing
before him, rigid with anger, her eyes
flaming with scorn and hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t dare to do it!&#8221; she said
hoarsely; &#8220;you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She snatched
suddenly for the butt of the weapon that
swung at his left hip, but with a quick motion
he evaded the hand and stepped back
a pace, smiling coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s the parson,&#8221; he said in a
low voice, which carried an air of finality.
He started for the door, hesitated, and came
back to the bunk, standing in front of Sheila,
looking down into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am giving you one last chance,&#8221; he
told her. &#8220;I am going to open the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
If you want the parson to die, don&#8217;t look at
me when he steps in. If you want him to
live, turn your back to him and walk to the
fireplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked to the door, unlocked it, and
stepped back, his gaze on Sheila. Then the
door opened slowly and the parson stood on
the threshold, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure some wet outside,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dakota was fingering the cylinder of his
revolver, his gaze now riveted on the parson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the latter, in surprise, seeing
the attitudes of Dakota and his guest,
&#8220;what in the name of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a movement, and Sheila stood
in front of Dakota, between him and the
parson. For an instant she stood, looking
at Dakota with a scornful, loathing gaze.
Then with a dry sob, which caught in her
throat, she moved past him and went to the
fireplace, where she stood looking down at
the flames.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THIS PICTURE AND THAT</h3>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>It</span> was a scene of wild, virgin beauty
upon which Sheila Langford looked as
she sat on the edge of a grassy butte
overlooking the Ute River, with Duncan,
the Double R manager stretched out, full
length beside her, a gigantic picture on Nature&#8217;s
canvas, glowing with colors which the
gods had spread with a generous touch.</p>
<p>A hundred feet below Sheila and Duncan
the waters of the river swept around the
base of the butte, racing over a rocky bed
toward a deep, narrow canyon farther down.
Directly opposite the butte rose a short
slope, forming the other bank of the river.
From the crest of the slope began a plain
that stretched for many miles, merging at
the horizon into some pine-clad foothills.
Behind the foothills were the mountains,
their snow peaks shimmering in a white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
sky&mdash;remote, mysterious, seeming like guardians
of another world. The chill of the
mountains contrasted sharply with the slumberous
luxuriance and color of the plains.</p>
<p>Miles of grass, its green but slightly
dulled with a thin covering of alkali dust,
spread over the plain; here and there a grove
of trees rose, it seemed, to break the monotony
of space. To the right the river doubled
sharply, the farther bank fringed with alder
and aspen, their tall stalks nodding above
the nondescript river weeds; the near bank a
continuing wall of painted buttes&mdash;red, picturesque,
ragged, thrusting upward and outward
over the waters of the river. On the
left was a stretch of broken country. Mammoth
boulders were strewn here; weird rocks
arose in inconceivably grotesque formations;
lava beds, dull and gray, circled the bald
knobs of some low hills. Above it all swam
the sun, filling the world with a clear, white
light. It made a picture whose beauty
might have impressed the most unresponsive.
Yet, though Sheila was looking upon
the picture, her thoughts were dwelling upon
another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>This other picture was not so beautiful,
and a vague unrest gripped Sheila&#8217;s heart
as she reviewed it, carefully going over each
gloomy detail. It was framed in the rain
and the darkness of a yesterday. There
was a small clearing there&mdash;a clearing in a
dense wood beside a river&mdash;the same river
which she could have seen below her now,
had she looked. In the foreground was a
cabin. She entered the cabin and stood beside
a table upon which burned a candle.
A man stood beside the table also&mdash;a reckless-eyed
man, holding a heavy revolver.
Another man stood there, too&mdash;a man of
God. While Sheila watched the man&#8217;s lips
opened; she could hear the words that came
through them&mdash;she would never forget them:</p>
<p>&#8220;To have and to hold from this day forth ... till
death do you part....&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a dream, it was the picture
of an actual occurrence. She saw every detail
of it. She could hear her own protests,
her threats, her pleadings; she lived over
again her terror as she had crouched in the
bunk until the dawn.</p>
<p>The man had not molested her, had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
even spoken to her after the ceremony; had
ignored her entirely. When the dawn came
she had heard him talking to the parson, but
could not catch their words. Later she had
mounted her pony and had ridden away
through the sunshine of the morning. She
had been married&mdash;it was her wedding day.</p>
<p>When she had reached the crest of a long
rise after her departure from the cabin she
had halted her pony to look back, hoping
that it all might have been a dream. But it
had not been a dream. There was the dense
wood, the clearing, and the cabin. Beside
them was the river. And there, riding
slowly away over the narrow trail which she
had traveled the night before, was the parson&mdash;she
could see his gray beard in the
white sunlight. Dry eyed, she had turned
from the scene. A little later, turning
again, she saw the parson fade into the horizon.
That, she knew, was the last she
would ever see of him. He had gone out
of her life forever&mdash;the desert had swallowed
him up.</p>
<p>But the picture was still vivid; she had
seen it during every waking moment of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
month that she had been at the Double R
ranch; it was before her every night in her
dreams. It would not fade.</p>
<p>She knew that the other picture was beautiful&mdash;the
picture of this world into which
she had ridden so confidently, yet she was
afraid to dwell upon it for fear that its
beauty would seem to mock her. For had
not nature conspired against her? Yet she
knew that she alone was to blame&mdash;she, obstinate,
willful, heedless. Had not her
father warned her? &#8220;Wait,&#8221; he had said,
and the words flamed before her eyes&mdash;&#8220;wait
until I go. Wait a month. The
West is a new country; anything, everything,
can happen to you out there&mdash;alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing can happen,&#8221; had been her
reply. &#8220;I will go straight from Lazette
to the Double R. See that you telegraph
instructions to Duncan to meet me. It will
be a change; I am tired of the East and impatient
to be away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, she had found a change. What
would her father say when he heard of it&mdash;of
her marriage to a cowboy, an unprincipled
scoundrel? What could he say? The marriage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
could be annulled, of course! it was
not legal, could not be legal. No law could
be drawn which would recognize a marriage
of that character, and she knew that she had
only to tell her father to have the machinery
of the law set in motion. Could she tell
him? Could she bear his reproaches, his
pity, after her heedlessness?</p>
<p>What would her friends say when they
heard of it&mdash;as they must hear if she went
to the law for redress? Her friends in the
East whose good wishes, whose respect, she
desired? Mockers there would be among
them, she was certain; there were mockers
everywhere, and she feared their taunts, the
shafts of sarcasm that would be launched at
her&mdash;aye, that would strike her&mdash;when they
heard that she had passed a night in a lone
cabin with a strange cowboy&mdash;had been married
to him!</p>
<p>A month had passed since the afternoon
on which she had ridden up to the porch of
the Double R ranchhouse to be greeted by
Duncan with the information that he had
that morning received a telegram from her
father announcing her coming. It had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
brought from Lazette by a puncher who had
gone there for the mail, and Duncan was at
that moment preparing to drive to Lazette
to meet her, under the impression that she
would arrive that day. There had been a
mistake, of course, but what did it matter
now? The damage had been wrought and
she closed her lips. A month had passed
and she had not told&mdash;she would never tell.</p>
<p>Conversations she had had with Duncan;
he seemed a gentleman, living at the Double
R ranchhouse with his sister, but in no conversation
with anyone had Sheila even mentioned
Dakota&#8217;s name, fearing that something
in her manner might betray her secret.
To everyone but herself the picture of her
adventure that night on the trail must remain
invisible.</p>
<p>She looked furtively at Duncan, stretched
out beside her on the grass. What would he
say if he knew? He would not be pleased,
she was certain, for during the month that
she had been at the Double R&mdash;riding out
almost daily with him&mdash;he had forced her
to see that he had taken a liking to her&mdash;more,
she herself had observed the telltale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
signs of something deeper than mere liking.</p>
<p>She had not encouraged this, of course,
for she was not certain that she liked Duncan,
though he had treated her well&mdash;almost
too well, in fact, for she had at times felt a
certain reluctance in accepting his little attentions&mdash;such
personal service as kept him
almost constantly at her side. His manner,
too, was ingratiating; he smiled too much
to suit her; his presumption of proprietorship
over her irritated her not a little.</p>
<p>As she sat beside him on the grass she
found herself studying him, as she had done
many times when he had not been conscious
of her gaze.</p>
<p>He was thirty-two,&mdash;he had told her so
himself in a burst of confidence&mdash;though she
believed him to be much older. The sprinkling
of gray hair at his temples had caused
her to place his age at thirty-seven or eight.
Besides, there were the lines of his face&mdash;the
set lines of character&mdash;indicating established
habits of thought which would not
show so deeply in a younger face. His
mouth, she thought, was a trifle weak, yet
not exactly weak either, but full-lipped and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
sensual, with little curves at the corners
which, she was sure, indicated either vindictiveness
or cruelty, perhaps both.</p>
<p>Taken altogether his was not a face to
trust fully; its owner might be too easily
guided by selfish considerations. Duncan
liked to talk about himself; he had been talking
about himself all the time that Sheila
had sat beside him reviewing the mental
picture. But apparently he had about exhausted
that subject now, and presently he
looked up at her, his eyes narrowing quizzically.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been here a month now,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;How do you like the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it,&#8221; she returned.</p>
<p>She was looking now at the other picture,
watching the shimmer of the sun on the distant
mountain peaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It improves,&#8221; he said, &#8220;on acquaintance&mdash;like
the people.&#8221; He flashed a smile
at her, showing his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen very many people,&#8221; she
returned, not looking at him, but determined
to ignore the personal allusion, to which,
plainly, he had meant to guide her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But those that you have seen?&#8221; he persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have formed no opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p>She <i>had</i> formed an opinion, though, a
conclusive one&mdash;concerning Dakota. But
she had no idea of communicating it to Duncan.
Until now, strangely enough, she had
had no curiosity concerning him. Bitter
hatred and resentment had been so active in
her brain that the latter had held no place
for curiosity. Or at least, if it had been
there, it had been a subconscious emotion,
entirely overshadowed by bitterness. Of
late, though her resentment toward Dakota
had not abated, she had been able to review
the incident of her marriage to him with
more composure, and therefore a growing
curiosity toward the man seemed perfectly
justifiable. Curiosity moved her now as she
smiled deliberately at Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen no one except your sister,
a few cowboys, and yourself. I haven&#8217;t paid
much attention to the cowboys, I like your
sister, and I am not in the habit of telling
people to their faces what I think of them.
The country does not appear to be densely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
populated. Are there no other ranches
around here&mdash;no other cattlemen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Double R ranch covers an area of
one hundred and sixty square miles,&#8221; said
Duncan. &#8220;The ranchhouse is right near
the center of it. For about twenty miles in
every direction you won&#8217;t find anybody but
Double R men. There are line-camps, of
course&mdash;dugouts where the men hang out
over night sometimes&mdash;but that&#8217;s all. To
my knowledge there are only two men with
shacks around here, and they&#8217;re mostly of
no account. One of them is Doubler&mdash;Ben
Doubler&mdash;who hangs out near Two Forks,
and the other is a fellow who calls himself
Dakota, who&#8217;s got a shack about twenty
miles down the Ute, a little off the Lazette
trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are ranchers, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s face was averted so that Duncan
might not see the interest in her eyes, or
the red which had suddenly come into her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ranchers?&#8221; There was a sneer in Duncan&#8217;s
laugh. &#8220;Well, you might call them
that. But they&#8217;re only nesters. They&#8217;ve
got a few head of cattle and a brand. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
likely they&#8217;ve put their brands on quite a
few of the Double R cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Sheila in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that I think they&#8217;re rustlers&mdash;cattle
thieves!&#8221; said Duncan venomously.</p>
<p>The flush had gone from Sheila&#8217;s cheeks;
she turned a pale face to the Double R manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have these men lived in the
vicinity of the Double R?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubler has been hanging around here
for seven or eight years. He was here when
I came and mebbe he&#8217;s been here longer.
Dakota&#8217;s been here about five years. He
bought his brand&mdash;the Star&mdash;from another
nester&mdash;Texas Blanca.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been stealing the Double R
cattle, you say?&#8221; questioned Sheila.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have them arrested?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan laughed mockingly. &#8220;Arrested!
That&#8217;s good. You&#8217;ve been living where
there&#8217;s law. But there&#8217;s no law out here;
no law to cover cattle stealing, except our
own. And then we&#8217;ve got to have the goods.
The sheriff won&#8217;t do anything when cattle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
are stolen, but he acts mighty sudden when
a man&#8217;s hung for stealing cattle, if the man
ain&#8217;t caught with the goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Caught with the goods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Caught in the act of stealing. If we
catch a man with the goods and hang him
there ain&#8217;t usually anything said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t been able to catch
these men, Dakota and Doubler, in the act
of stealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re too foxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were manager of this ranch and
suspected anyone of stealing any of its cattle,
I would catch them!&#8221; There was a note
of angry impatience in Sheila&#8217;s voice which
caused Duncan to look sharply at her. He
reddened, suspecting disparagement of his
managerial ability in the speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe,&#8221; he said, with an attempt at
lightness. &#8220;But as a general thing nosing
out a rustler is a pretty ticklish proposition.
Nobody goes about that work with a whole
lot of enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; There was scorn in Sheila&#8217;s
voice, scorn in her uplifted chin. But she
did not look at Duncan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Well, because
it&#8217;s perfectly natural for a man to want to
live as long as he can. I don&#8217;t like them
nesters&mdash;Dakota especially&mdash;and I&#8217;d like
mighty well to get something on them. But
I ain&#8217;t taking any chances on Dakota.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Again the monosyllable was
pregnant with scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot that you ain&#8217;t acquainted out
here,&#8221; laughed the manager. &#8220;No one is
taking any chances with Dakota&mdash;not even
the sheriff. There&#8217;s something about the
cuss which seems to discourage a man when
he&#8217;s close to him&mdash;close enough to do any
shooting. I&#8217;ve seen Dakota throw down on
a man so quick that it would make you
dizzy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot at a man. There was a gambler
over in Lazette thought to euchre Dakota.
A gunman he was, from Texas, and&mdash;well,
they carried the gambler out. It was done
so sudden that nobody saw it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed him?&#8221; There was repressed
horror in Sheila&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he wasn&#8217;t entirely put out of business.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Dakota only made him feel cheap.
Creased him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Creased him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grazed his head with the bullet. Done
it intentionally, they say. Told folks he
didn&#8217;t have any desire to send the gambler
over the divide; just wanted to show him
that when he was playin&#8217; with fire he ought
to be careful. There ain&#8217;t no telling what
Dakota&#8217;d do if he got riled, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s gaze was on Duncan fairly, her
eyes alight with contempt. &#8220;So you are
all afraid of him?&#8221; she said, with a bitterness
that surprised the manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon it would amount to
about that, if you come right down to the
truth,&#8221; he confessed, reddening a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are afraid of him, too I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it ain&#8217;t just that,&#8221; he parried,
&#8220;but I ain&#8217;t taking any foolish risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila rose and walked to her pony, which
was browsing the tops of some mesquite
near by. She reached the animal, mounted,
and then turned and looked at Duncan
scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;A while ago you asked for my opinion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
of the people of this country,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
am going to express that opinion now. It
is that, in spite of his unsavory reputation,
Dakota appears to be the only <i>man</i> here!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took up the reins and urged her pony
away from the butte and toward the level
that stretched away to the Double R buildings
in the distance. For an instant Duncan
stood looking after her, his face red with
embarrassment, and then with a puzzled
frown he mounted and followed her.</p>
<p>Later he came up with her at the Double
R corral gate and resumed the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I reckon you ain&#8217;t got no use for
rustlers?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning Dakota?&#8221; she questioned, a
smoldering fire in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; she said, facing Duncan, her
eyes flashing, &#8220;that you would kill him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said Duncan, changing
color.</p>
<p>But Sheila had dismounted and was walking
rapidly toward the ranchhouse, leaving
Duncan alone with his unfinished speech and
his wonder.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>DAKOTA EVENS A SCORE</h3>
</div>

<p>With the thermometer at one hundred
and five it was not to be expected
that there would be much
movement in Lazette. As a matter of fact,
there was little movement anywhere. On
the plains, which began at the edge of town,
there was no movement, no life except
when a lizard, seeking a retreat from the
blistering sun, removed itself to a deeper
shade under the leaves of the sage-brush, or
a prairie-dog, popping its head above the
surface of the sand, took a lightning survey
of its surroundings, and apparently dissatisfied
with the outlook whisked back into
the bowels of the earth.</p>
<p>There was no wind, no motion; the little
whirlwinds of dust that arose settled quickly
down, the desultory breezes which had
caused them departing as mysteriously as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
they had come. In the blighting heat the
country lay, dead, spreading to the infinite
horizons; in the sky no speck floated against
the dome of blue. More desolate than a
derelict on the calm surface of the trackless
ocean Lazette lay, its huddled buildings
dingy with the dust of a continuing dry season,
squatting in their dismal lonesomeness
in the shimmering, blinding sun.</p>
<p>In a strip of shade under the eaves of
the station sat the station agent, gazing
drowsily from under the wide brim of his
hat at the two glistening lines of steel that
stretched into the interminable distance.
Some cowponies, hitched to rails in front
of the saloons and the stores, stood with
drooping heads, tormented by myriad flies;
a wagon or two, minus horses, occupied a
space in front of a blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>In the Red Dog saloon some punchers on
a holiday played cards at various tables,
quietly drinking. Behind the rough bar
Pete Moulin, the proprietor stood, talking
to his bartender, Blacky.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that jasper&#8217;s back again,&#8221; commented
the proprietor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which?&#8221; The bartender followed the
proprietor&#8217;s gaze, which was on a man
seated at a card table, his profile toward
them, playing cards with several other men.
The bartender&#8217;s face showed perplexity.</p>
<p>Moulin laughed. &#8220;I forgot you ain&#8217;t
been here that long,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That was
before your time. That fellow settin&#8217; sideways
to us is Texas Blanca.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he callin&#8217; himself &#8216;Texas&#8217; for?&#8221;
queried the bartender. &#8220;He looks more like
a greaser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Breed, I reckon,&#8221; offered the proprietor.
&#8220;Claims to have punched cows in
Texas before he come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he allowin&#8217; to be now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knows. Used to own the Star&mdash;Dakota&#8217;s
brand. Sold out to Dakota five
years ago. Country got too hot for him an&#8217;
he had to pull his freight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rustler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said something. He&#8217;s been suspected
of it. But nobody&#8217;s talkin&#8217; very loud
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not safe. He&#8217;s lightning with a six.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Got his nerve to come back here, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you heard about it? I thought
everybody&#8217;d heard about that deal. Blanca
sold Dakota the Star. Then he pulled his
freight immediate. A week or so later Duncan,
of the Double R, rides up to Dakota&#8217;s
shack with a bunch of Double R boys an&#8217;
accuses Dakota of rustlin&#8217; Double R cattle.
Duncan had found twenty Double R calves
runnin&#8217; with the Star cattle which had been
marked secret. Blanca had run his iron on
them an&#8217; sold them to Dakota for Star stock.
Dakota showed Duncan his bill of sale, all
regular, an&#8217; of course Duncan couldn&#8217;t
blame him. But there was some hard words
passed between Duncan an&#8217; Dakota, an&#8217;
Dakota ain&#8217;t allowin&#8217; they&#8217;re particular
friends since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota had to give up the calves, sure
enough, an&#8217; he did. But sore! Dakota was
sure some disturbed in his mind. He didn&#8217;t
show it much, bein&#8217; one of them quiet kind,
but he says to me one day not long after
Duncan had got the calves back: &#8216;I&#8217;ve
been stung, Pete,&#8217; he says, soft an&#8217; even like;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
&#8216;I&#8217;ve been stung proper, by that damned
oiler. Not that I&#8217;m carin&#8217; for the money
end of it; Duncan findin&#8217; them calves with
my stock has damaged my reputation.&#8217;
Then he laffed&mdash;one of them little short
laffs which he gets off sometimes when
things don&#8217;t just suit him&mdash;the way he&#8217;s
laffed a couple of times when someone&#8217;s
tried to run a cold lead proposition in on
him. He fair freezes my blood when he
gets it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he says to me: &#8216;Mebbe I&#8217;ll be
runnin&#8217; in with Blanca one of these days.&#8217;
An&#8217; that&#8217;s all he ever says about it. Likely
he expected Blanca to come back. An&#8217; sure
enough he has. Reckon he thinks that
mebbe Dakota didn&#8217;t get wise to the calf
deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In his place,&#8221; said Blacky, eyeing
Blanca furtively, &#8220;I&#8217;d be makin&#8217; some inquiries.
Dakota ain&#8217;t no man to trifle
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trifle!&#8221; Moulin&#8217;s voice was pregnant
with awed admiration. &#8220;I reckon there
ain&#8217;t no one who knows Dakota&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
trifle with him&mdash;he&#8217;s discouraged that long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
ago. Square, too, square as they make &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord knows the country needs
square men,&#8221; observed Blacky.</p>
<p>He caught a sign from a man seated
at a table and went over to him with a bottle
and a glass. While Blacky was engaged in
this task the door opened and Dakota came
in.</p>
<p>Moulin&#8217;s admiration and friendship for
Dakota might have impelled him to warn
Dakota of the presence of Blanca, and he
did hold up a covert finger, but Dakota at
that moment was looking in another direction
and did not observe the signal.</p>
<p>He continued to approach the bar and
Blacky, having a leisure moment, came forward
and stood ready to serve him. A short
nod of greeting passed between the three,
and Blacky placed a bottle on the bar and
reached for a glass. Dakota made a negative
sign with his head&mdash;short and resolute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in for supplies,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;but
not that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not drinkin&#8217;?&#8221; queried Moulin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pure as the driven snow,&#8221; drawled
Dakota.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How long has that been goin&#8217; on?&#8221;
Moulin&#8217;s grin was skeptical.</p>
<p>&#8220;A month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moulin looked searchingly at Dakota,
saw that he was in earnest, and suddenly
reached a hand over the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hate to knock my
own business, an&#8217; you&#8217;ve been a pretty good
customer, but if you mean it, it&#8217;s the most
sensible thing you ever done. Of course you
didn&#8217;t hit it regular, but there&#8217;s been times
when I&#8217;ve thought that if I could have three
or four customers like you I&#8217;d retire in a
year an&#8217; spend the rest of my life countin&#8217;
my dust!&#8221; He was suddenly serious, catching
Dakota&#8217;s gaze and winking expressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend of yourn here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dakota took a flashing glance at the men
at the card tables and Moulin saw his lips
straighten and harden. But in the next
instant he was smiling gravely at the proprietor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Pete,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;But
you&#8217;re some reckless with the English language
when you&#8217;re calling him my friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Maybe he&#8217;ll be proving that he didn&#8217;t mean
to skin me on that deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled again and then left the bar and
strode toward Blanca. The latter continued
his card playing, apparently unaware
of Dakota&#8217;s approach, but at the sound of
his former victim&#8217;s voice he turned and
looked up slowly, his face wearing a bland
smile.</p>
<p>It was plain to Moulin that Blanca had
known all along of Dakota&#8217;s presence in the
saloon&mdash;perhaps he had seen him enter.
The other card players ceased playing and
leaned back in their chairs, watching, for
some of them knew something of the calf
deal, and there was that in Dakota&#8217;s greeting
to Blanca which warned them of impending
trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blanca,&#8221; said Dakota quietly, &#8220;you can
pay for those calves now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It pleased Blanca to dissemble. But it
was plain to Moulin&mdash;as it must have been
plain to everybody who watched Blanca&mdash;that
a shadow crossed his face at Dakota&#8217;s
words. Evidently he had entertained a hope
that his duplicity had not been discovered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Calves?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What calves, my
frien&#8217;?&#8221; He dropped his cards to the table
and turned his chair around, leaning far
back in it and hooking his right thumb in
his cartridge belt, just above the holster
of his pistol. &#8220;I theenk it mus&#8217; be mistak&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Dakota, a slow, grimly
humorous smile reaching his face, &#8220;it was
a mistake. You made it, Blanca. Duncan
found it out. Duncan took the calves&mdash;they
belonged to him. You&#8217;re going to pay for
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I pay for heem?&#8221; The bland smile on
Blanca&#8217;s face had slowly faded with the realization
that his victim was not to be further
misled by him. In place of the smile his
face now wore an expression of sneering
contempt, and his black eyes had taken on
a watchful glitter. He spoke slowly: &#8220;I
pay for no calves, my frien&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pay,&#8221; said Dakota, an ominously
quiet drawl in his voice, &#8220;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or what?&#8221; Blanca showed his white
teeth in a tigerish smirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;This town ain&#8217;t big enough for both of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
us,&#8221; said Dakota, his eyes cold and alert as
they watched Blanca&#8217;s hand at his cartridge
belt. &#8220;One of us will leave it by sundown.
I reckon that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He deliberately turned his back on
Blanca and walked to the door, stepping
down into the street. Blanca looked after
him, sneering. An instant later Blanca
turned and smiled at his companions at the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t my funeral,&#8221; said one of the
card players, &#8220;but if I was in your place
I&#8217;d begin to think that me stayin&#8217; here was
crowdin&#8217; the population of this town by
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blanca&#8217;s teeth gleamed. &#8220;My frien&#8217;,&#8221; he
said insinuatingly, &#8220;it&#8217;s your deal.&#8221; His
smile grew. &#8220;Thees is a nize country,&#8221; he
continued. &#8220;I like it ver&#8217; much. I come
back here to stay. Dakota&mdash;hees got the
Star too cheap.&#8221; He tapped his gun holster
significantly. &#8220;To-night Dakota hees
go somewhere else. To-morrow who takes
the Star? You?&#8221; He pointed to each of
the card players in turn. &#8220;You?&#8221; he questioned.
&#8220;You take it?&#8221; He smiled at their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
negative signs. &#8220;Well, then, Blanca take
it. Peste! Dakota give himself till sundown!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The six-o&#8217;clock was an hour and thirty
minutes late. For two hours Sheila Langford
had been on the station platform awaiting
its coming. For a full half hour she had
stood at one corner of the platform straining
her eyes to watch a thin skein of smoke
that trailed off down the horizon, but which
told her that the train was coming. It
crawled slowly&mdash;like a huge serpent&mdash;over
the wilderness of space, growing always
larger, steaming its way through the golden
sunshine of the afternoon, and after a time,
with a grinding of brakes and the shrill hiss
of escaping air, it drew alongside the station
platform.</p>
<p>A brakeman descended, the conductor
strode stiffly to the telegrapher&#8217;s window,
two trunks came out of the baggage car,
and a tall man of fifty alighted and was
folded into Sheila&#8217;s welcoming arms. For a
moment the two stood thus, while the passengers
smiled sympathetically. Then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
man held Sheila off at arm&#8217;s length and
looked searchingly at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crying?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What a welcome!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, daddy!&#8221; said Sheila. In this moment
she was very near to telling him what
had happened to her on the day of her
arrival at Lazette, but she felt that it was
impossible with him looking at her; she
could not at a blow cast a shadow over the
joy of his first day in the country where,
henceforth, he was to make his home. And
so she stood sobbing softly on his shoulder
while he, aware of his inability to cope with
anything so mysterious as a woman&#8217;s tears,
caressed her gently and waited patiently for
her to regain her composure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then nothing happened to you after
all,&#8221; he laughed, patting her cheeks.
&#8220;Nothing, in spite of my croaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she answered. The opportunity
was gone now; she was committed
irrevocably to her secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like it here? Duncan has made
himself agreeable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a beautiful country, though a little
lonesome after&mdash;after Albany. I miss my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
friends, of course. But Duncan&#8217;s sister has
done her best, and I have been able to get
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>The engine bell clanged and they stood
side by side as the train pulled slowly away
from the platform. Langford solemnly
waved a farewell to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the moment for which I have
been looking for months,&#8221; he said, with
what, it seemed to Sheila, was almost a sigh
of relief. He turned to her with a smile.
&#8220;I will look after the baggage,&#8221; he said,
and leaving her he approached the station
agent and together they examined the
trunks which had come out of the baggage
car.</p>
<p>Sheila watched him while he engaged in
this task. His face seemed a trifle drawn;
he had aged much during the month that
she had been separated from him. The lines
of his face had grown deeper; he seemed,
now that she saw him at a distance, to be
care-worn&mdash;tired. She had heard people
call him a hard man; she knew that business
associates had complained of what they were
pleased to call his &#8220;sharp methods&#8221;; it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
even been hinted that his &#8220;methods&#8221; were
irregular.</p>
<p>It made no difference to her, however,
what people thought of him, or what they
said of him, he had been a kind and indulgent
parent to her and she supposed that in
business it was everybody&#8217;s business to look
sharply after their own interests. For there
were jealous people everywhere; envy stalks
rampant through the world; failure cavils at
mediocrity, mediocrity sneers at genius.
And Sheila had always considered her
father a genius, and the carping of those
over whom her father had ridden roughshod
had always sounded in her ears like
tributes.</p>
<p>As quite unconsciously we are prone to
place the interests of self above considerations
for the comfort and the convenience
of others, so Sheila had grown to judge her
father through the medium of his treatment
of her. Her own father&mdash;who had died during
her infancy&mdash;could not have treated her
better than had Langford. Since her
mother&#8217;s death some years before, Langford
had been both father and mother to her, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
her affection for him had flourished in the
sunshine of his. No matter what other
people thought, she was satisfied with him.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact David Dowd Langford
allowed no one&mdash;not even Sheila&mdash;to
look into his soul. What emotions slumbered
beneath the mask of his habitual imperturbability
no one save Langford himself
knew. During all his days he had successfully
fought against betraying his emotions
and now, at the age of fifty, there was
nothing of his character revealed in his face
except sternness. If addicted to sharp practice
in business no one would be likely to suspect
it, not even his victim. Could one have
looked steadily into his eyes one might find
there a certain gleam to warn one of trickery,
only one would not be able to look
steadily into them, for the reason that they
would not allow you. They were shifty,
crafty eyes that took one&#8217;s measure when
one least expected them to do so.</p>
<p>Over the motive which had moved her
father to retire from business while still in
his prime Sheila did not speculate. Nor had
she speculated when he had bought the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Double R ranch and announced his intention
to spend the remainder of his days on
it. She supposed that he had grown tired
of the unceasing bustle and activity of city
life, as had she, and longed for something
different, and she had been quite as eager
as he to take up her residence here. This
had been the limit of her conjecturing.</p>
<p>He had told her when she left Albany
that he would follow her in a month. And
therefore, in a month to the day, knowing
his habit of punctuality, Sheila had come
to Lazette for him, having been driven over
from the Double R by one of the cowboys.</p>
<p>She saw the station agent now, beckoning
to the driver of the wagon, and she went
over to the edge of the station platform and
watched while the trunks were tumbled into
the wagon.</p>
<p>The driver was grumbling good naturedly
to Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;That darned six-o&#8217;clock train is always
late,&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s a quarter to
eight now an&#8217; the sun is goin&#8217; down. If
that train had been on time we could have
made part of the trip in the daylight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>The day had indeed gone. Sheila looked
toward the mountains and saw that great
long shadows were lengthening from their
bases; the lower half of the sun had sunk
behind a distant peak; the quiet colors of
the sunset were streaking the sky and glowing
over the plains.</p>
<p>The trunks were in; the station agent
held the horses by the bridles, quieting them;
the driver took up the reins; Sheila was
helped to the seat by her father, he jumped
in himself, and they were off down the
street, toward a dim trail that led up a
slope that began at the edge of town and
melted into space.</p>
<p>The town seemed deserted. Sheila saw a
man standing near the front door of a saloon,
his hands on his hips. He did not
appear interested in either the wagon or its
occupants; his gaze roved up and down the
street and he nervously fingered his cartridge
belt. He was a brown-skinned man,
almost olive, Sheila thought as her gaze
rested on him, attired after the manner of
the country, with leathern chaps, felt hat,
boots, spurs, neckerchief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it is sundown already!&#8221; Sheila
heard her father say. &#8220;What a sudden
change! A moment ago the light was perfect!&#8221;</p>
<p>A subconscious sense only permitted
Sheila to hear her father&#8217;s voice, for her
thoughts and eyes were just then riveted on
another man who had come out of the door
of another saloon a little way down the
street. She recognized the man as Dakota
and exclaimed sharply.</p>
<p>She felt her father turn; heard the driver
declare, &#8220;It&#8217;s comin&#8217; off,&#8221; though she had
not the slightest idea of his meaning. Then
she realized that he had halted the horses;
saw that he had turned in his seat and was
watching something to the rear of them
intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re out of range,&#8221; she heard him say,
speaking to her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; This was her father&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota an&#8217; Blanca are havin&#8217; a run-in,&#8221;
announced the driver. &#8220;Dakota&#8217;s give
Blanca till sundown to get out of town. It&#8217;s
sundown now an&#8217; Blanca ain&#8217;t pulled his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
freight, an&#8217; it&#8217;s likely that hell will be a-poppin&#8217;
sorta sudden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila cowered in her seat, half afraid to
look at Dakota&mdash;who was walking slowly
toward the man who still stood in front of
the saloon&mdash;though in spite of her fears and
misgivings the fascination of the scene held
her gaze steadily on the chief actors.</p>
<p>Out of the corners of her eyes she could
see that far down the street men were congregated;
they stood in doorways, at convenient
corners, their eyes directed toward
Dakota and the other man. In the sepulchral
calm which had fallen there came to
Sheila&#8217;s ears sounds that in another time
she would not have noticed. Somewhere a
door slammed; there came to her ears the
barking of a dog, the neigh of a horse&mdash;sharply
the sounds smote the quiet atmosphere,
they seemed odd to the point of unreality.</p>
<p>However, the sounds did not long distract
her attention from the chief actors in the
scene which was being worked out in front
of her; the noises died away and she gave
her entire attention to the men. She saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Dakota reach a point about thirty feet from
the man in front of the saloon&mdash;Blanca. As
Dakota continued to approach, Sheila observed
an evil smile flash suddenly to
Blanca&#8217;s face; saw a glint of metal in the
faint light; heard the crash of his revolver;
shuddered at the flame spurt. She expected
to see Dakota fall&mdash;hoped that he might.
Instead, she saw him smile&mdash;in much the
fashion in which he had smiled that night
in the cabin when he had threatened to shoot
the parson if she did not consent to marry
him. And then his hand dropped swiftly to
the butt of the pistol at his right hip.</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s eyes closed; she swayed and felt
her father&#8217;s arm come out and grasp her to
keep her from falling. But she was not going
to fall; she had merely closed her eyes to
blot out the scene which she could not turn
from. She held her breath in an agony of
suspense, and it seemed an age until she
heard a crashing report&mdash;and then another.
Then silence.</p>
<p>Unable longer to resist looking, Sheila
opened her eyes. She saw Dakota walk
forward and stand over Blanca, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
down at him, his pistol still in hand. Blanca
was face down in the dust of the street, and
as Dakota stood over him Sheila saw the
half-breed&#8217;s body move convulsively and
then become still. Dakota sheathed his
weapon and, without looking toward the
wagon in which Sheila sat, turned and
strode unconcernedly down the street. A
man came out of the door of the saloon in
front of which Blanca&#8217;s body lay, looking
down at it curiously. Other men were running
toward the spot; there were shouts,
oaths.</p>
<p>For the first time in her life Sheila had
seen a man killed&mdash;murdered&mdash;and there
came to her a recollection of Dakota&#8217;s words
that night in the cabin: &#8220;Have you ever
seen a man die?&#8221; She had surmised from
his manner that night that he would not
hesitate to kill the parson, and now she knew
that her sacrifice had not been made in vain.
A sob shook her, the world reeled, blurred,
and she covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said in a strained, hoarse
voice. &#8220;Oh! The brute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; From a great distance the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
driver&#8217;s voice seemed to come. &#8220;Hey!
What&#8217;s that? Well, mebbe. But I reckon
Blanca won&#8217;t rustle any more cattle.&#8221;
&#8220;God!&#8221; he added in an awed voice; &#8220;both
of them hit him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blanca was dead then, there could be no
doubt of that. Sheila felt herself swaying
and tried to grasp the end of the seat to
steady herself. She heard her father&#8217;s voice
raised in alarm, felt his arm come out again
and grasp her, and then darkness settled
around her.</p>
<p>When she recovered consciousness her
father&#8217;s arms were still around her and the
buckboard was in motion. Dusk had come;
above her countless stars flickered in the
deep blue of the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon she&#8217;s plum shocked,&#8221; she heard
the driver say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; returned Langford,
and Sheila felt a shiver run over him.
&#8220;Great guns!&#8221; Sheila wondered at the
tone he used. &#8220;That man is a marvel with
a pistol! Did you notice how cool he took
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool!&#8221; The driver laughed. &#8220;If you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
get acquainted with Dakota you&#8217;ll find out
that he&#8217;s cool. He&#8217;s an iceberg, that&#8217;s what
he is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll arrest him, I suppose?&#8221; queried
Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrest him! What for? Didn&#8217;t he give
Blanca his chance? That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
you he&#8217;s cool!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was past two o&#8217;clock when the buckboard
pulled up at the Double R corral gates
and Langford helped Sheila down. She was
still pale and trembling and did not remain
downstairs to witness her father&#8217;s introduction
to Duncan&#8217;s sister, but went immediately
to her room. Sleep was far from her,
however, for she kept dwelling over and
over on the odd fortune which had killed
Blanca and allowed Dakota to live, when
the latter&#8217;s death would have brought to an
end the distasteful relationship which his
freakish impulse had forced upon her.</p>
<p>She remembered Dakota&#8217;s words in the
cabin. Was Fate indeed running this
game&mdash;if game it might be called?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>KINDRED SPIRITS</h3>
</div>

<p>Looking rather more rugged than
when he had arrived at the station
at Lazette two weeks before, his face
tanned, but still retaining the smooth, sleek
manner which he had brought with him from
the East, David Dowd Langford sat in a
big rocking chair on the lower gallery of
the Double R ranchhouse, mentally appraising
Duncan, who was seated near by, his
profile toward Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this Ben Doubler has been a thorn
in your side?&#8221; questioned Langford softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; returned Duncan, with
an evil smile. &#8220;He has been and still is.
And now I&#8217;m willing him to you. I don&#8217;t
know when I&#8217;ve been more tickled over getting
rid of a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Langford, leaning farther
back in his chair and clasping his hands,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
resting his chin on his thumbs, his lips curving
with an ironic smile, &#8220;I suppose I ought
to feel extremely grateful to you&mdash;especially
since when I was negotiating the purchase
of the ranch you didn&#8217;t hint of a nester
being on the property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sell Doubler to you,&#8221; said Duncan.</p>
<p>Langford&#8217;s smile was shallow. &#8220;But I
get him just the same,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a
usual thing it is pretty hard to get rid of a
nester, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been able to get rid of this
one,&#8221; returned Duncan. &#8220;He don&#8217;t seem
to be influenced by anything I say, or do.
Some obstinate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tried everything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The law?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan made a gesture of disgust. &#8220;The
law!&#8221; he said. &#8220;What for? I haven&#8217;t been
such a fool. He&#8217;s got as much right to the
open range as I have&mdash;as you will have. I
bought a section, and he took up a quarter
section. The only difference between us is
that I own mine&mdash;or did own it until you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
bought it&mdash;and he ain&#8217;t proved on his. He
is on the other side of the river and I&#8217;m on
this. Or rather,&#8221; he added with a grin,
&#8220;he&#8217;s on the other side and you are on this.
He&#8217;s got the best grass land in the country&mdash;and
plenty of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His rights, then,&#8221; remarked Langford
slowly, &#8220;equal yours&mdash;or mine. That is,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;he makes free use of the grass
and water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which reduces the profits of the Double
R,&#8221; pursued Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you knew that when you sold me
the Double R,&#8221; continued Langford, his
voice smooth and silky.</p>
<p>Duncan flashed a grin at the imperturbable
face of the new owner. &#8220;I reckon I
wasn&#8217;t entirely ignorant of it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad business,&#8221; remarked Langford
in a detached manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221; Duncan&#8217;s face reddened
slightly. &#8220;You mean that it was bad business
for me to sell when I knowed Doubler
owned land near the Double R?&#8221; There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
was a slight sneer in his voice as he looked
at Langford. &#8220;You&#8217;ve never been stung
before, eh? Well, there&#8217;s always a first
time for everything, and I reckon&mdash;according
to what I&#8217;ve heard&mdash;that you ain&#8217;t been
exactly no Sunday school scholar yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford&#8217;s eyes were narrowed to slits.
&#8220;I meant that it was bad business to allow
Doubler&#8217;s presence on the Two Forks to
affect the profits of the Double R. Perhaps
I have been stung&mdash;as you call it&mdash;but if I
have been I am not complaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s eyes glinted with satisfaction.
He had expected a burst of anger from the
new owner when he should discover that the
value of his property was impaired by the
presence of a nester near it, but the new
owner apparently harbored no resentment
over this unforeseen obstacle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m admitting,&#8221; said Duncan, &#8220;that
Doubler being there is bad business. But
how are you going to prevent him staying
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you tried&#8221;&mdash;Langford looked
obliquely at Duncan, drawling significantly&mdash;&#8220;force?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have tried everything, I told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan gazed at Langford with a new
interest. It was the first time since the new
owner had come to the Double R that he
had dropped the mask of sleek smoothness
behind which he concealed his passions.
Even now the significance was more in his
voice than in his words, and Duncan began
to comprehend that Langford was deeper
than he had thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see that you appreciate the
situation,&#8221; he said, smiling craftily. &#8220;Some
men are mighty careful not to do anything
to hurt anybody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford favored Duncan with a steady
gaze, which the latter returned, and both
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business,&#8221; presently said Langford
with a quiet significance which was not lost
on Duncan, &#8220;good business, demands the
application of certain methods which are not
always agreeable to the opposition.&#8221; He
took another sly glance at Duncan. &#8220;There
ought to be a good many ways of making
it plain to Doubler that he isn&#8217;t wanted in
this section of the country,&#8221; he insinuated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to make some of the ways
plain,&#8221; said Duncan with a cold grin. &#8220;I
got to the end of my string and hadn&#8217;t any
more things to try. That&#8217;s why I decided
to sell. I wanted to get away where I
wouldn&#8217;t be bothered. But I reckon that
you&#8217;ll be able to fix up something for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the two weeks that Langford had
been at the Double R Duncan had studied
him from many angles and this exchange of
talk had convinced him that he had not erred
in his estimate of the new owner&#8217;s character.
As he had hinted to Langford, he had tried
many plans to rid the country of the nester,
and he remembered a time when Doubler
had seen through one of his schemes to
fasten the crime of rustling on him and had
called him to account, and the recollection
of what had happened at the interview between
them was not pleasant. He had not
bothered Doubler since that time, though
there had lingered in his heart a desire for
revenge. Many times, on some pretext or
other, he had tried to induce his men to
clash with Doubler, but without success. It
had appeared to him that his men suspected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
his motives and deliberately avoided the
nester.</p>
<p>With a secret satisfaction he had watched
Langford&#8217;s face this morning when he had
told him that Doubler had long been suspected
of rustling; that the men of the
Double R had never been able to catch him
in the act, but that the number of cattle
missing had seemed to indicate the nester&#8217;s
guilt.</p>
<p>Doubler&#8217;s land was especially desirable,
he had told Langford, and this was the
truth. It was a quarter section lying adjacent
to good water, and provided the best
grass in the vicinity. Duncan had had
trouble with Doubler over the water rights,
too, but had been unsuccessful in ousting
him because of the fact that since Doubler
controlled the land he also controlled the
water rights of the river adjoining it. The
Two Forks was the only spot which could be
used by thirsty cattle in the vicinity, for the
river at other points was bordered with cliffs
and hills and was inaccessible. And Doubler
would not allow the Double R cattle to
water at the Two Forks, though he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
issued this edict after his trouble with the
Double R owner. Duncan, however, did not
explain this to Langford.</p>
<p>The latter looked at him with a smooth
smile. &#8220;It is plain from what you have
been telling me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that there is no
possibility of you succeeding in reaching a
satisfactory agreement with Doubler, and
therefore I expect that I will have to deal
with him personally. I shall ride over some
day and have a talk with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prospect of becoming involved with
the nester gave Langford a throb of joy.
All his life he had been engaged in the task
of overcoming business obstacles and he had
reached the conclusion that the situation
which now confronted him was nothing
more or less than business. Of course it was
not the business to which he had been accustomed,
but it offered the opportunity for
cold-blooded, merciless planning for personal
gain; there were the elements of profit
and loss; it would give him an opportunity
to apply his peculiar genius, to grapple, to
battle, and finally overthrow the opposing
force.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>Though he had allowed Duncan to see
nothing of the emotions that rioted within
him over the discovery that he had been victimized
by the latter&mdash;at least to the extent
of misrepresentation in the matter of the
nester&mdash;there was in his mind a feeling of
deep resentment against the former owner;
he felt that he could no longer trust him,
but for the sake of learning all the details of
the new business he felt that he would have
to make the best of a bad bargain. He had
already arranged with Duncan to remain at
the Double R throughout the season, but he
purposed to leave him out of any dealings
that he might have with Doubler. He
smiled as he looked at Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this country,&#8221; he said, leaning
back in his chair and drawing a deep breath.
&#8220;I was rather afraid at first that I would
find it dull after the East. But this situation
gives promise of action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan was watching him with a crafty
smile. &#8220;You reckon on running him off,
or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He leered at Langford significantly.</p>
<p>The latter&#8217;s face was impassive, his smile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
dry. &#8220;Eh?&#8221; he said, abstractedly, as
though his thoughts had been wandering
from the subject. &#8220;Why, I really haven&#8217;t
given a thought to the method by which I
ought to deal with Doubler. Perhaps,&#8221; he
added with a genial smile, &#8220;I may make a
friend of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He observed Duncan&#8217;s scowl and his smile
grew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>BOGGED DOWN</h3>
</div>

<p>Each day during the two weeks that
her father had been at the Double R
Sheila had accompanied him on his
rides of exploration. She had grown tired
of the continued companionship, and despite
the novelty of the sight she had become decidedly
wearied of looking at the cowboys
in their native haunts. Not that they did
not appeal to her, for on the contrary she
had found them picturesque and had admired
their manliness, but she longed to ride
out alone where she could brood over her
secret. The possession of it had taken the
flavor out of the joys of this new life, had
left it flat and filled with bitter memories.</p>
<p>She had detected a change in her father&mdash;he
seemed coarse, domineering, entirely unlike
his usual self. She attributed this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
change in him to the country&mdash;it was hard
and rough, and of course it was to be expected
that Langford&mdash;or any man, for that
matter&mdash;taking an active interest in ranch
life, must reflect the spirit of the country.</p>
<p>She had developed a positive dislike for
Duncan, which she took no trouble to conceal.
She had discovered that the suspicions
she had formed of his character during
the first days of their acquaintance were
quite correct&mdash;he was selfish, narrow, and
brutal. He had accompanied her and her
father on all their trips and his manner toward
her had grown to be one of easy familiarity.
This was another reason why she
wanted to ride alone.</p>
<p>The day before she had spoken to Langford
concerning the continued presence of
Duncan on their rides, and he had laughed
at her, assuring her that Duncan was not a
&#8220;bad fellow,&#8221; and though she had not taken
issue with him on this point she had decided
that hereafter, in self protection, she would
discontinue her rides with her father as long
as he was accompanied by the former owner.</p>
<p>Determined to carry out this decision, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
was this morning saddling her pony at the
corral gates when she observed Duncan
standing near, watching her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have let me throw that saddle
on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She flushed, angered that he should have
been watching her without making his presence
known. &#8220;I prefer to put the saddle on
myself,&#8221; she returned, busying herself with
it after taking a flashing glance at him.</p>
<p>He laughed, pulled out a package of tobacco
and some paper, and proceeded to roll
a cigarette. When he had completed it he
held a match to it and puffed slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cross this morning,&#8221; he taunted.</p>
<p>There was no reply, though Duncan
might have been warned by the dark red in
her cheeks. She continued to work with the
saddle, lacing the latigo strings and tightening
the cinches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re riding down to the box canyon
on the other side of the basin this morning,&#8221;
said Duncan. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got some strays
penned up there. But your dad won&#8217;t be
ready for half an hour yet. You&#8217;re in something
of a hurry, it seems.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are going, I suppose?&#8221; questioned
Sheila, pulling at the rear cinch, the pony
displaying a disinclination to allow it to be
buckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Sheila, straightening
and facing him, &#8220;why you have to go with
father everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan flushed. &#8220;Your father&#8217;s aiming
to learn the business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m showing
him, telling him what I know about it.
There&#8217;s a chance that I won&#8217;t be with the
Double R after the fall round-up, if a deal
which I have got on goes through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose you have a corner on all
the knowledge of ranch life,&#8221; suggested
Sheila sarcastically.</p>
<p>He flushed darkly, but did not answer.</p>
<p>After Sheila had completed the tightening
of the cinches she led the pony beside the
corral fence, mounted, and without looking
at Duncan started to ride away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; he shouted, and she drew the
pony to a halt and sat in the saddle, looking
down at him with a contemptuous gaze as
he stood in front of her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you was going with your
father?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken.&#8221; She could not repress
a smile over the expression of disappointment
on his face. But without giving
him any further satisfaction she urged her
pony forward, leaving him standing beside
the corral gates watching her with a frown.</p>
<p>She smiled many times while riding toward
the river, thinking of his discomfiture,
reveling in the thought that for once she had
shown him that she resented the attitude of
familiarity which he had adopted toward
her.</p>
<p>She sat erect in the saddle, experiencing
a feeling of elation which brought the color
into her face and brightened her eyes. It
was the first time since her arrival at the
Double R that she had been able to ride out
alone, and it was also the first time that she
really appreciated the vastness and beauty
of the country. For the trail to the river,
which she had decided she would follow, led
through a fertile country where the bunch
grass grew long and green, the barren
stretches of alkali were infrequent, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
where the low wooded hills and the shallow
gullies seemed to hint at the mystery. Before
long the depression which had made her life
miserable had fled and she was enjoying herself.</p>
<p>When she reached the river she crossed it
at a shallow and urged her pony up a sloping
bank and out upon a grass plain that
spread away like the level of a great, green
sea. Once into the plain, though, she discovered
that its promise of continuing green
was a mere illusion, for the grass grew here
in bunches, the same as it grew on the
Double R side of the river. Yet though she
was slightly disappointed she found many
things to interest her, and she lingered long
over the odd rock formations that she encountered
and spent much time peering
down into gullies and exploring sand draws
which seemed to be on every side.</p>
<p>About noon, when she became convinced
that she had seen everything worth seeing
in that section of the country, she wheeled
her pony and headed it back toward the
river. She reached it after a time and urged
her beast along its banks, searching for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
shallow which she had crossed some time before.
A dim trail led along the river and
she felt certain that if she followed it long
enough it would lead her to the crossing, but
after riding half an hour and encountering
nothing but hills and rock cliffs she began to
doubt. But she rode on for another half
hour and then, slightly disturbed over her
inability to find the shallow, she halted the
pony and looked about her.</p>
<p>The country was strange and unfamiliar
and a sudden misgiving assailed her. Had
she lost her idea of direction? She looked
up at the sun and saw that it was slightly
past the zenith on its downward path. She
smiled. Of course all she had to do was to
follow the river and in time she would come
in sight of the Double R buildings. Certain
that she had missed the shallow because of
her interest in other things, she urged her
pony about and cantered it slowly over the
back trail. A little later, seeing an arroyo
which seemed to give promise of leading to
the shallow she sought, she descended it and
found that it led to a flat and thence to the
river. The crossing seemed unfamiliar, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
yet she supposed that one crossing would do
quite as well as another, and so she smiled
and continued on toward it.</p>
<p>There was a fringe of shrubbery at the
edge of what appeared to have once been a
swamp, though now it was dry and made
fairly good footing for her pony. The animal
acted strangely, however, when she tried
to urge it through the fringing shrubbery,
and she was compelled to use her quirt vigorously.</p>
<p>Once at the water&#8217;s edge she halted the
pony and viewed the crossing with satisfaction.
She decided that it was a much better
crossing than the one she had encountered
on the trip out. It was very shallow, not
over thirty feet wide, she estimated, and
through the clear water she could easily see
the hard, sandy bottom. It puzzled her
slightly to observe that there were no wagon
tracks or hoof prints in the sand anywhere
around her, as there would be were the crossing
used ever so little. It seemed to be an
isolated section of the country though, and
perhaps the cattlemen used the crossing little&mdash;there
was even a chance that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
the first to discover its existence. She must
remember to ask someone about it when she
returned to the Double R.</p>
<p>She urged the pony gently with her
booted heel and voice, but the little animal
would not budge. Impatient over its obstinacy,
she again applied the quirt vigorously.
Stung to desperation the pony stood
erect for an instant, pawing the air frantically
with its fore hoofs, and then, as the
quirt continued to lash its flanks, it lunged
forward, snorting in apparent fright, made
two or three eccentric leaps, splashing water
high over Sheila&#8217;s head, and then came to a
sudden stop in the middle of the stream.</p>
<p>Sheila nibbled at her lips in vexation.
Again, convinced that the pony was merely
exhibiting obstinacy, she applied the quirt
to its flanks. The animal floundered and
struggled, but did not move out of its tracks.</p>
<p>Evidently something had gone wrong.
Sheila peered over the pony&#8217;s mane into the
water, which was still clear in spite of the
pony&#8217;s struggling, and sat suddenly erect,
stifling cry of amazement. The pony was
mired fast! Its legs, to a point just above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
the knees, had disappeared into the river
bottom!</p>
<p>As she straightened, a chilling fear clutching
at her heart, she felt the cold water of
the river splashing against her booted legs.
And now knowledge came to her in a sudden,
sickening flood. She had ridden her
pony fairly into a bed of quicksand!</p>
<p>For some minutes she sat motionless in
the saddle, stunned and nerveless. She saw
now why there were no tracks or hoof prints
leading down into the crossing. She remembered
now that Duncan had warned her of
the presence of quicksand in the river, but
the chance of her riding into any of it had
seemed to be so remote that she had paid
very little attention to Duncan&#8217;s warning.
Much as she disliked the man she would have
given much to have him close at hand now.
If he had only followed her!</p>
<p>She was surprised at her coolness. She
realized that the situation was precarious,
for though she had never before experienced
a quicksand, she had read much of them in
books, and knew that the pony was hopelessly
mired. But it seemed that there could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
be no immediate danger, for the river bottom
looked smooth and hard; it was grayish-black,
and she was so certain that the
footing was good that she pulled her feet out
of the stirrups, swung around, and stepped
down into the water.</p>
<p>She had stepped lightly, bearing only a
little of her weight on the foot while holding
to the saddle, but the foot sank instantly
into the sand and the water darkened around
it. She tried again in another spot, putting
a little more weight on her foot this time.
She went in almost to the knee and was surprised
to find that she had to exert some little
strength to pull the foot out, there was so
great a suction.</p>
<p>With the discovery that she was really in
a dangerous predicament came a mental
panic which threatened to take the form of
hysteria. She held tightly to the pommel
of the saddle, shutting her eyes on the desolate
world around her, battling against the
great fear that rose within her and choked
her. When she opened her eyes again the
world was reeling and objects around her
were strangely blurred, but she held tightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
to the saddle, telling herself that she must
retain her composure, and after a time she
regained the mastery over herself.</p>
<p>With the return of her mental faculties
she began to give some thought to escape.
But escape seemed to be impossible. Looking
backward toward the bank she had left,
she saw that the pony must have come fifteen
or twenty feet in the two or three
plunges it had made. She found herself
wondering how it could have succeeded in
coming that distance. Behind her the water
had become perfectly clear, and the impressions
left by the pony&#8217;s hoofs had filled up
and the river bottom looked as smooth and
inviting as it had seemed when she had urged
the pony into it.</p>
<p>In front of her was a stretch of water of
nearly the same width as that which lay behind
her. To the right and left the grayish-black
sand spread far, but only a short distance
beyond where she could discern the
sand there were rocks that stuck above the
water with little ripples around them.</p>
<p>The rocks were too far away to be of
any assistance to her, however, and her heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
sank when she realized that her only hope of
escape lay directly ahead.</p>
<p>She leaned over and laid her head against
the pony&#8217;s neck, smoothing and patting its
shoulders. The animal whinnied appealingly
and she stifled a sob of remorse over
her action in forcing it into the treacherous
sand, for it had sensed the danger while
obeying her blindly.</p>
<p>How long she lay with her head against
the pony&#8217;s neck she did not know, but when
she finally sat erect again she found that the
water was touching the hem of her riding
skirt and that her feet, dangling at each side
of the pony, were deep in the sand of the
river bottom. With a cry of fright she drew
them out and crossed them before her on the
pommel of the saddle. With the movement
the pony sank several inches, it seemed to
her; she saw the water suddenly flow over
its back; heard it neigh loudly, appealingly,
with a note of anguish and terror which
seemed almost human, and feeling a sudden,
responsive emotion of horror and despair,
Sheila bowed her head against the pony&#8217;s
mane and sobbed softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>They would both die, she knew&mdash;horribly.
They would presently sink beneath the surface
of the sand, the water would flow over
them and obliterate all traces of their graves,
and no one would ever know what had become
of them.</p>
<p>Some time later&mdash;it might have been five
minutes or an hour&mdash;Sheila could not have
told&mdash;she heard the pony neigh again, and
this time it seemed there was a new note in
the sound&mdash;a note of hope! She raised her
head and looked up. And there on the bank
before her, uncoiling his rope from the saddle
horn and looking very white and grim,
was Dakota!</p>
<p>Sheila sat motionless, not knowing
whether to cry or laugh, finally compromising
with the appeal, uttered with all the
composure at her command:</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please get us out of here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I am aiming to do,&#8221; he said,
and never did a voice sound sweeter in her
ears; at that moment she almost forgave him
for the great crime he had committed against
her.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>He seemed not in the least excited, continuing
to uncoil his rope and recoil it again
into larger loops. &#8220;Hold your hands over
your head!&#8221; came his command.</p>
<p>She did as she was bidden. He had not
dismounted from his pony, but had ridden
up to the very edge of the quicksand, and as
she raised her hands she saw him twirl the
rope once, watched as it sailed out, settled
down around her waist, and was drawn
tight.</p>
<p>There was now a grim smile on his face.
&#8220;You&#8217;re in for a wetting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry&mdash;but it can&#8217;t be helped. Get your feet
off to one side so that you won&#8217;t get mixed
up with the saddle. And keep your head
above the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-s,&#8221; she answered tremulously, dreading
the ordeal, dreading still more the
thought of her appearance when she would
finally reach the bank.</p>
<p>His pony was in motion instantly, pulling
strongly, following out its custom of dragging
a roped steer, and Sheila slipped off the
saddle and into the water, trying to keep her
feet under her. But she overbalanced and
fell with a splash, and in this manner was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
dragged, gasping, strangling, and dripping
wet, to the bank.</p>
<p>Dakota was off his pony long before she
had reached the solid ground and was at
her side before she had cleared the water,
helping her to her feet and loosening the
noose about her waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please!&#8221; she said frigidly, as his
hand touched her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t.&#8221; He smiled and stepped
back while she fumbled with the rope and
finally threw it off. &#8220;What made you try
that shallow?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I have a right to ride where I
please?&#8221; He had saved her life, of course,
and she was very grateful to him, but that
was no reason why he should presume to
speak familiarly to her. She really believed&mdash;in
spite of the obligation under which he
had placed her&mdash;that she hated him more
than ever.</p>
<p>But he did not seem to be at all disturbed
over her manner. On the contrary, looking
at him and trying her best to be scornful, he
seemed to be laboring heroically to stifle
some emotion&mdash;amusement, she decided&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
she tried to freeze him with an icy stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you don&#8217;t look dignified, for a
fact,&#8221; he grinned, brazenly allowing his
mirth to show in his eyes and in the sudden,
curved lines that had come around his mouth.
&#8220;Still, you couldn&#8217;t expect to look dignified,
no matter how hard you tried, after being
dragged through the water like that. Now
could you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the first time that I have amused
you!&#8221; she said with angry sarcasm.</p>
<p>A cloud passed over his face, but was instantly
superseded by a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you haven&#8217;t forgotten?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She did not deign to answer, but turned
her back to him and looked at her partially
submerged pony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to try it again?&#8221; he said mockingly.</p>
<p>She turned slowly and looked at him,
her eyes flashing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please stop being silly!&#8221; she
said coldly. &#8220;If you were human you would
be trying to get my pony out of that sand
instead of standing there and trying to be
smart!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think that I was going to let
him drown?&#8221; His smile had in it a quality
of subtle mockery which made her eyes blaze
with anger. Evidently he observed it for he
smiled as he walked to his pony, coiling his
rope and hanging it from the pommel of the
saddle. &#8220;I certainly am not going to let
your horse drown,&#8221; he assured her, &#8220;for in
this country horses are sometimes more valuable
than people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you save the pony
first?&#8221; she demanded hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I,&#8221; he returned, fixing her
with an amused glance, &#8220;with you looking
so appealingly at me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned abruptly and left him, walking
to a flat rock and seating herself upon
it, wringing the water from her skirts, trying
to get her hair out of her eyes, feeling
very miserable, and wishing devoutly that
Dakota might drown himself&mdash;after he
had succeeded in pulling the pony from the
quicksand.</p>
<p>But Dakota did not drown himself. Nor
did he pull the pony out of the quicksand.
She watched him as he rode to the water&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
edge and looked at the animal. Her heart
sank when he turned and looked gravely at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon your pony&#8217;s done for, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything of him above
the sand but his head and a little of his neck.
He&#8217;s too far gone, ma&#8217;am. In half an hour
he&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila stood up, wet and excited. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you do something?&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
you pull him out with your lariat&mdash;like you
did me?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a grim humor in his smile.
&#8220;What do you reckon would have happened
to you if I had tried to pull you out by the
neck?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t you do <i>something</i>?&#8221; she
pleaded, her icy attitude toward him melting
under the warmth of her affection and sympathy
for the unfortunate pony. &#8220;Please
do something!&#8221; she begged.</p>
<p>His face changed expression and he
tapped one of his holsters significantly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only this left, I reckon. Pulling
him out by the neck would break it, sure.
And it&#8217;s never a nice thing to see&mdash;or hear&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
horse or a cow sinking in quicksand. I&#8217;ve
seen it once or twice and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila shuddered and covered her face
with her hands, for his words had set her imagination
to working.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said and became silent.</p>
<p>Dakota stood for a moment, watching her,
his face grim with sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like to shoot him, any more than you want
to see it done. I reckon, though, that the
pony would thank me for doing it if he could
have anything to say about it.&#8221; He walked
over close to her, speaking in a low voice.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t stay here, of course. You&#8217;ll
have to take my horse, and you&#8217;ll have to go
right now, if you don&#8217;t want to be around
when the pony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, interrupting
him. He relapsed into silence, and stood
gravely watching her as she resumed her
toilet.</p>
<p>She disliked to accept his offer of the
pony, but there seemed to be no other way.
She certainly could not walk to the Double
R ranchhouse, even to satisfy a desire to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
show him that she would not allow him to
place her under any obligation to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to tell you one thing,&#8221; he said
presently, standing erect and looking earnestly
at her. &#8220;If Duncan is responsible
for your safety in this country he isn&#8217;t showing
very good judgment in letting you run
around alone. There are dangers that you
know nothing about, and you don&#8217;t know a
thing about the country. Someone ought to
take care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you did, for example,&#8221; she retorted,
filled with anger over his present solicitation
for her welfare, as contrasted to his treatment
of her on another occasion.</p>
<p>A slow red filled his cheeks. Evidently
he did possess <i>some</i> self-respect, after all.
Contrition, too, she thought she could detect
in his manner and in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t hurt you, anyway,&#8221; he said,
eyeing her steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you call ruining a woman&#8217;s name
not &#8216;hurting&#8217; her,&#8221; she answered bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for that, Miss Sheila,&#8221; he
said earnestly. &#8220;I had an idea that night&mdash;and
still have it, for that matter&mdash;that I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
an instrument&mdash; Well, I had an idea, that&#8217;s
all. But I haven&#8217;t told anybody about what
happened&mdash;I haven&#8217;t even hinted it to anybody.
And I told the parson to get out of
the country, so he wouldn&#8217;t do any gassing
about it. And I haven&#8217;t been over to Dry
Bottom to have the marriage recorded&mdash;and
I am not going to go. So that you can have
it set aside at any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, she could have the marriage annulled,
she knew that. But the contemplation
of her release from the tie that bound
her to him did not lessen the gravity of the
offense in her eyes. She told herself that she
hated him with a remorseless passion which
would never cease until he ceased to live.
No action of his could repair the damage he
had done to her. She told him so, plainly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were so blood-thirsty
as that,&#8221; he laughed in quiet mockery.
&#8220;Maybe it would be a good thing for you if
I did die&mdash;or get killed. But I&#8217;m not allowing
that I&#8217;m ready to die yet, and certainly
am not going to let anybody kill me if I can
prevent it. I reckon you&#8217;re not thinking of
doing the killing yourself?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I told my father&mdash;&#8221; she began, but
hesitated when she saw his lips suddenly
straighten and harden and his eyes light with
a deep contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you haven&#8217;t told your father?&#8221; he
laughed. &#8220;I was sure you had taken him
into your confidence by this time. But I
reckon it&#8217;s a mighty good thing that you
didn&#8217;t&mdash;for your father. Like as not if you&#8217;d
tell him he&#8217;d get some riled and come right
over to see me, yearning for my blood. And
then I&#8217;d have to shoot him up some. And
that would sure be too bad&mdash;you loving him
as you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you would shoot him like you
shot that poor fellow in Lazette,&#8221; she
taunted, bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like I did that poor fellow in Lazette,&#8221;
he said, with broad, ironic emphasis. &#8220;You
saw me shoot Blanca, of course, for you were
there. But you don&#8217;t know what made me
shoot him, and I am not going to tell you&mdash;it&#8217;s
none of your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; Her voice was burdened
with contempt. &#8220;I suppose you take a certain
pride in your ability to murder people.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
She placed a venomous accent on the &#8220;Murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of people ought to be murdered,&#8221;
he drawled, using the accent she had used.</p>
<p>Her contempt of him grew. &#8220;Then I
presume you have others in mind&mdash;whom
you will shoot when the mood strikes you?&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221; His smile was mysterious
and mocking, and she saw in his eyes the
reckless gleam which she had noted that
night while in the cabin with him. She shuddered
and walked to the pony&mdash;his pony.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have quite finished I believe I
will be going,&#8221; she said, holding her chin
high and averting her face. &#8220;I will have
one of the men bring your horse to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I have quite finished,&#8221; he returned,
mimicking her cold, precise manner
of speech.</p>
<p>She disdainfully refused his proffer of assistance
and mounted the pony. He stood
watching her with a smile, which she saw by
glancing covertly at him while pretending
to arrange the stirrup strap. When she
started to ride away without even glancing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
at him, she heard his voice, with its absurd,
hateful drawl:</p>
<p>&#8220;And she didn&#8217;t even thank me,&#8221; he said
with mock bitterness and disappointment.</p>
<p>She turned and made a grimace at him.
He bowed and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are entirely welcome,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He was standing on the edge of the quicksand,
watching her, when she reached the
long rise upon which she had sat on her pony
on a day some weeks before, and when she
turned he waved a hand to her. A little
later she vanished over the rise, and she had
not ridden very far when she heard the dull
report of his pistol. She shivered, and rode
on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>SHEILA FANS A FLAME</h3>
</div>

<p>Sheila departed from the quicksand
crossing nursing her wrath against the
man who had rescued her, feeling bitterly
vindictive against him, yet aware that
the Dakota who had saved her life was not
the Dakota whom she had feared during her
adventure with him in his cabin on the night
of her arrival in the country. He had
changed, and though she assured herself
that she despised him more than ever, she
found a grim amusement in the recollection
of his manner immediately following the
rescue, and in a review of the verbal battle,
in which she had been badly worsted.</p>
<p>His glances had had in them the quality
of inward mirth and satisfaction which is
most irritating, and behind his pretended remorse
she could see a pleasure over her dilemma
which made her yearn to inflict
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
punishment upon him that would cause him
to ask for mercy. His demeanor had said
plainly that if she wished to have the marriage
set aside all well and good&mdash;he would
offer no objection. But neither would he
take the initiative. Decidedly, it was a matter
in which she should consult her own desires.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when she rode
up to the Double R corral gates and was
met there by her father and Duncan. Langford
had been worried, he said, and was
much concerned over her appearance. In
the presence of Duncan Sheila told him the
story of her danger and subsequent rescue
by Dakota and she saw his eyes narrow with
a strange light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the chap
who shot that half-breed over in Lazette the
day I came?&#8221;</p>
<p>To Sheila&#8217;s nod he ejaculated: &#8220;He&#8217;s a
trump!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a brute!&#8221; As the words escaped
her lips&mdash;she had not meant to utter them&mdash;Sheila
caught a glint in Duncan&#8217;s eyes which
told her that she had echoed the latter&#8217;s sentiments,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
and she felt almost like retracting
the charge. She had to bite her lips to resist
the impulse.</p>
<p>&#8220;A brute, eh?&#8221; laughed Langford. &#8220;It
strikes me that I wouldn&#8217;t so characterize a
man who had saved my life. The chances
are that after saving you he didn&#8217;t seem delighted
enough, or he didn&#8217;t smile to suit
you, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t so awful much of a man,&#8221; remarked
Duncan disparagingly.</p>
<p>Langford turned and looked at Duncan
with a comprehending smile. &#8220;Evidently
you owe Dakota nothing, my dear Duncan,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>The latter&#8217;s face darkened, and with
Sheila listening he told the story of the calf
deal, which had indirectly brought about the
death of Blanca.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a long time we had suspected Texas
Blanca of rustling,&#8221; said Duncan, &#8220;but we
couldn&#8217;t catch him with the goods. Five
years ago, after the spring round-up, I
branded a bunch of calves with a secret
mark, and then we rode sign on Blanca.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had him then, for the calves disappeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
and some of the boys found some of
them in Blanca&#8217;s corral, but we delayed,
hoping he would run off more, and while we
were waiting he sold out to Dakota. We
didn&#8217;t know that at the time; didn&#8217;t find it
out until we went over to take Blanca and
found Dakota living in his cabin. He had
a bill of sale from Blanca all right, showing
that he&#8217;d bought the calves from him. It
looked regular, but we had our doubts, and
Dakota and me came pretty near having a
run-in. If the boys hadn&#8217;t interfered&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated and looked at Sheila, and as
her gaze met his steadily his eyes wavered
and a slow red came into his face, for the
recollection of what had actually occurred
at the meeting between him and Dakota was
not pleasant, and since that day Duncan had
many times heard the word &#8220;Yellow&#8221;
spoken in connection with his name&mdash;which
meant that he lacked courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he wasn&#8217;t a rustler, after all?&#8221; said
Sheila pleasantly. For some reason which
she could not entirely explain, she suspected
that Duncan had left many things out of his
story of his clash with Dakota.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; admitted Duncan grudgingly.</p>
<p>Sheila was surprised at the satisfaction
she felt over this admission. Perhaps Duncan
read her face as she had read his, for he
frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Him and Blanca framed up&mdash;making
believe that Blanca had sold him the Star
brand,&#8221; he said venomously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; Sheila&#8217;s eyes met
Duncan&#8217;s and the latter&#8217;s wavered. She was
not certain which gave her the thrill she felt&mdash;her
defense of Dakota or Duncan&#8217;s bitter
rage over the exhibition of that defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t appear to me to be the sort
of man who would steal cows,&#8221; she said with
a smile which made Duncan&#8217;s teeth show.
&#8220;Although,&#8221; she continued significantly,
&#8220;it does seem that he is the sort of man I
would not care to trifle with&mdash;if I were a
man. You told me yourself, if you remember,
that you were not taking any chances
with him. And now you accuse him. If I
were you,&#8221; she warned, &#8220;I would be more
careful&mdash;I would keep from saying things
which I could not prove.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that I&#8217;m afraid of him, I
reckon?&#8221; sneered Duncan.</p>
<p>Sheila looked at him, her eyes alight with
mischief. That day on the edge of the butte
overlooking the river, when Duncan had
talked about Dakota, she had detected in his
manner an inclination to belittle the latter;
several times since then she had heard him
speak venomously of him, and she had suspected
that all was not smooth between
them. And now since Duncan had related
the story of the calf incident she was certain
that the relations between the two men were
strained to the point of open rupture. Duncan
had bothered her, had annoyed her with
his attentions, had adopted toward her an
air of easy familiarity, which she had deeply
resented, and she yearned to humiliate him
deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221; She appeared to hesitate.
&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; she said, surveying him with an
appraising eye in which the mischief was
partly concealed, &#8220;I do not believe that you
are afraid. Perhaps you are merely careful
where he is concerned. But I am certain
that even if you were afraid of him you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
would not refuse to take his pony back. I
promised to send it back, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>A deep red suddenly suffused Duncan&#8217;s
face. A sharp, savage gleam in his eyes&mdash;which
Sheila met with a disarming smile&mdash;convinced
her that he was aware of her object.
She saw also that he did not intend to
allow her to force him to perform the service.</p>
<p>He bowed and regarded her with a shallow
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will have one of the boys take the pony
over to him the first thing in the morning,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>Sheila smiled sweetly. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t
bother,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of allowing
one of the men to take the pony back.
Perhaps I shall decide to ride over that way
myself. I should not care to have you meet
Dakota if you are afraid of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her rippling laugh caused the red in
Duncan&#8217;s face to deepen, but she gave him
no time to reply, for directly she had spoken
she turned and walked toward the ranchhouse.
Both Duncan and Langford
watched her until she had vanished, and then
Langford turned to Duncan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth have you done to her?&#8221;
he questioned.</p>
<p>But Duncan was savagely pulling the saddle
from Dakota&#8217;s pony and did not answer.</p>
<p>Sheila really had no expectation of prevailing
upon Duncan to return Dakota&#8217;s
horse, and had she anticipated that the manager
would accept her challenge she would
not have given it, for after thinking over the
incident of her rescue she had come to the
conclusion that she had not treated Dakota
fairly, and by personally taking his horse to
him she would have an opportunity to proffer
her tardy thanks for his service. She
did not revert to the subject of the animal&#8217;s
return during the evening meal, however,
nor after it when she and her father and
Duncan sat on the gallery of the ranchhouse
enjoying the cool of the night breezes.</p>
<p>After breakfast on the following morning
she was standing near the windmill, watching
the long arms travel lazily in their wide
circles, when she saw Duncan riding away
from the ranchhouse, leading Dakota&#8217;s
pony. She started toward the corral gates,
intending to call to him to return, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
thought better of the impulse and hailed him
tauntingly instead:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please tell him to accept my thanks,&#8221;
she said, and Duncan turned his head, bowed
mockingly, and continued on his way.</p>
<p>Half an hour after the departure of Duncan
Sheila pressed a loafing puncher into
service and directed him to rope a gentle
pony for her. After the puncher had secured
a suitable appearing animal and had
placed a saddle and bridle on it, she compelled
him to ride it several times around
the confines of the pasture to make certain
that it would not &#8220;buck.&#8221; Then she
mounted and rode up the river.</p>
<p>Duncan was not particularly pleased over
his errand, and many times while he rode the
trail toward Dakota&#8217;s cabin his lips moved
from his teeth in a snarl. Following the incident
of the theft of the calves by Blanca,
Duncan had taken pains to insinuate publicly
that Dakota&#8217;s purchase of the Star from
the half-breed had been a clever ruse to avert
suspicion, intimating that a partnership existed
between Dakota and Blanca. The
shooting of Blanca by Dakota, however, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
exploded this charge, and until now Duncan
had been very careful to avoid a meeting
with the man whom he had maligned.</p>
<p>During the night he had given much
thought to the circumstance which was sending
him to meet his enemy. He had a suspicion
that Sheila had purposely taunted
him with cowardice&mdash;that in all probability
Dakota himself had suggested the plan in
order to force a meeting with him. This
thought suggested another. Sheila&#8217;s defense
of Dakota seemed to indicate that a
certain intimacy existed between them. He
considered this carefully, and with a throb
of jealously concluded that Dakota&#8217;s action
in saving Sheila&#8217;s life would very likely pave
the way for a closer acquaintance.</p>
<p>Certainly, in spite of Sheila&#8217;s remark
about Dakota being a &#8220;brute,&#8221; she had betrayed
evidence of admiration for the man.
In that case her veiled allusions to his own
fear of meeting Dakota were very likely
founded on something which Dakota had
told her, and certainly anything which Dakota
might have said about him would not
be complimentary. Therefore his rage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
against both Sheila and his enemy was bitter
when he finally rode up to the door of the
latter&#8217;s cabin.</p>
<p>There was hope in his heart that Dakota
might prove to be absent, and when, after
calling once and receiving no answer, he dismounted
and hitched Dakota&#8217;s pony to a
rail of the corral fence, there was a smile of
satisfaction on his face.</p>
<p>He took plenty of time to hitch the pony;
he even lingered at the corral bars, leaning
on them to watch several steers which were
inside the enclosure. He found time, too,
in spite of his fear of his enemy, to sneer
over the evidences of prosperity which were
on every hand. He was congratulating
himself on his good fortune in reaching Dakota&#8217;s
cabin during a time when the latter
was absent, when he heard a slight sound behind
him. He turned rapidly, to see Dakota
standing in the doorway of the cabin,
watching him with cold, level eyes, one of
his heavy six-shooters in hand.</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s face went slowly pale. He did
not speak at once and when he did he was
surprised at his hoarseness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought your cayuse back,&#8221; he said
finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; returned Dakota. His eyes
glinted with a cold humor, though they were
still regarding Duncan with an alertness
which the other could not mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; repeated Dakota. His slow
drawl was in evidence again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t recollect,
though, that I sent word to have <i>you</i>
bring him back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t tickled to death over the job,&#8221;
returned Duncan.</p>
<p>Now that his first surprise was over and
Dakota had betrayed no sign of resenting
his visit, Duncan felt easier. There had
been a slight sneer in his voice when he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t surprising,&#8221; returned Dakota.
&#8220;There never was a time when you were
tickled a heap to stick your nose into my
affairs.&#8221; His smile froze Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t looking for trouble,&#8221; said the latter,
with a perfect knowledge of Dakota&#8217;s
peculiar expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you come over here? I
reckon there wasn&#8217;t anyone else to send my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
horse over by?&#8221; said Dakota, his voice coming
with a truculent snap.</p>
<p>Duncan flushed. &#8220;Sheila Langford sent
me,&#8221; he admitted reluctantly.</p>
<p>Dakota&#8217;s eyes lighted with incredulity.
&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re a liar,&#8221; he said with cold
emphasis.</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s gaze went to the pistol in Dakota&#8217;s
hand and his lips curled. He knew
that he was perfectly safe so long as he
made no hostile move, for in spite of his
derogatory remarks about the man he was
aware that he never used his weapons without
provocation.</p>
<p>Therefore he forced a smile. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t
running no Blanca deal on me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Calling me a liar ain&#8217;t going to get no rise
out of me. But she sent me, just the same.
I reckon, liking you as I do, that I ought
to be glad she gave me the chance to come
over and see you, but I ain&#8217;t. We was gassing
about you and she told me I was scared
to bring your cayuse back.&#8221; He laughed
mirthlessly. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve proved that I
ain&#8217;t any scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dakota with a cold grin,
&#8220;you ain&#8217;t scared. You know that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
won&#8217;t be any shooting done unless you get
careless with that gun you carry.&#8221; His
eyes were filled with a whimsical humor, but
they were still alert, as he watched Duncan&#8217;s
face for signs of insincerity. He saw no
such signs and his expression became mocking.
&#8220;So she sent you over here?&#8221; he said,
and his was the voice of one enemy enjoying
some subtle advantage over another. &#8220;Why,
I reckon you&#8217;re a kind of handy man to have
around&mdash;sort of ladies&#8217; man&mdash;running errands
and such.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s face bloated with anger, but he
dared not show open resentment. For behind
Dakota&#8217;s soft voice and gentle, over-polite
manner, he felt the deep rancor for
whose existence he alone was responsible.
So, trying to hold his passions in check, he
grinned at Dakota, significantly, insinuatingly,
unable finally to keep the bitter hatred
and jealousy out of his voice. For in
the evilness of his mind he had drawn many
imaginary pictures of what had occurred between
Dakota and Sheila immediately after
her rescue by the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; he said hoarsely, &#8220;that you
take a heap of interest in Sheila.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of your business, I suppose?&#8221;
Dakota&#8217;s voice was suddenly hard.</p>
<p>Duncan had decided to steer carefully
away from any trouble with Dakota; he had
even decided that as a measure for his own
safety he must say nothing which would be
likely to arouse Dakota&#8217;s anger, but the
jealous thoughts in his mind had finally gotten
the better of prudence, and the menace
in Dakota&#8217;s voice angered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; he said with a sneer, &#8220;that I
ain&#8217;t as much interested in her as you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started back, his lips tightening over
his teeth in a snarl of alarm and fear, for
Dakota had stepped down from the doorway
and was at his side, his eyes narrowed
with cold wrath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning what?&#8221; he demanded harshly,
sharply, for he imagined that perhaps Sheila
had told of her marriage to him, and the
thought that Duncan should have been selected
by her to share the secret maddened
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning what, you damned coyote?&#8221;
he insisted, stepping closer to Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that she ain&#8217;t admiring you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
for nothing,&#8221; flared Duncan incautiously,
his jealously overcoming his better judgment.
&#8220;Meaning that any woman which
has been pulled out of a quicksand like you
pulled her out might be expected to favor
you with&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sunlight flashed on Dakota&#8217;s pistol
as it leaped from his right hand to his left
and was bolstered with a jerk. And with
the same motion his clenched fist was
jammed with savage force against Duncan&#8217;s
lips, cutting short the slanderous words and
sending him in a heap to the dust of the corral
yard.</p>
<p>With a cry of rage Duncan grasped for
his pistol and drew it out, but the hand holding
it was stamped violently into the earth,
the arm bent and twisted until the fingers
released the weapon. And then Dakota
stood over him, looking down at him with
narrowed, chilling eyes, his face white and
hard, his anger gone as quickly as it had
come. He said no word while Duncan
clambered awkwardly to his feet and
mounted his horse.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you something,&#8221; he said
quietly, as Duncan lifted the reins with his
uninjured hand, turning his horse to depart.
&#8220;You and me have never hitched
very well and there isn&#8217;t any chance of us
ever falling on each other&#8217;s necks. I think
what I&#8217;ve done to you about squares us for
that calf deal. I&#8217;ve been yearning to hand
you something before you left the country,
but I didn&#8217;t expect you&#8217;d give me the chance
in just this way. I&#8217;m warning you that the
next time you shove your coyote nose into
my business I&#8217;ll muss it up some. That applies
to Miss Sheila. If I ever hear of you
getting her name on your dirty tongue again
I&#8217;ll tear you apart. I reckon that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
He drew his pistol and balanced it in his
right hand. &#8220;It makes me feel some reckless
to be talking to you,&#8221; he added, a glint
of intolerance in his eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;d better
travel before I change my mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to mention this to Miss
Sheila,&#8221; he said mockingly, as Duncan urged
his horse away from the corral gate; &#8220;just
let her go on&mdash;thinking you&#8217;re a man.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>STRICTLY BUSINESS</h3>
</div>

<p>For two or three quiet weeks Sheila
did not see much of Duncan, and her
father bothered her very little. Several
nights on the gallery of the ranchhouse
she had seen the two men sitting very close
together, and on one or two occasions she
had overheard scraps of conversation carried
on between them in which Doubler&#8217;s
name was mentioned.</p>
<p>She remembered Doubler as one of the
nesters whom Duncan had mentioned that
day on the butte overlooking the river, and
though her father and Duncan had a perfect
right to discuss him, it seemed to Sheila
that there had been a serious note in their
voices when they had mentioned his name.</p>
<p>She had become acquainted with Doubler.
Since discontinuing her rides with her father
and Duncan she had gone out every day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
alone, though she was careful to avoid any
crossing in the river which looked the least
suspicious. Such crossings as she could
ford were few, and for that reason she was
forced to ride most of the time to the Two
Forks, where there was an excellent shallow,
with long slopes sweeping up to the
plains on both sides.</p>
<p>The first time that she crossed at the Two
Forks she had come upon a small adobe
cabin situated a few hundred yards back
from the water&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>Sheila would have fled from the vicinity,
for there was still fresh in her mind a recollection
of another cabin in which she had
once passed many fearsome hours, but while
she hesitated, on the verge of flight, Doubler
came to the door, and when she saw that
he was an old man with a kindly face, much
of her perturbation vanished, and she remained
to talk.</p>
<p>Doubler was hospitable and solicitous and
supplied her with some soda biscuit and fresh
beef and a tin cup full of delicious coffee.
She refused to enter the cabin, and so he
brought the food out to her and sat on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
step beside her while she ate, betraying much
interest in her.</p>
<p>Doubler asked no questions regarding her
identity, and Sheila marveled much over
this. But when she prepared to depart she
understood why he had betrayed no curiosity
concerning her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re that Langford girl?&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Sheila, wondering. &#8220;I
am Sheila Langford. But who told you?
I was not aware that anyone around here
knew me&mdash;except the people at the Double
R.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; A chill came into her voice which
instantly attracted Doubler&#8217;s attention. He
looked at her with an odd smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know Dakota?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have met him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like him, I reckon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; commented Doubler, &#8220;I
reckon I&#8217;ve got things mixed. But from
Dakota&#8217;s talk I took it that you an&#8217; him was
pretty thick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;His talk?&#8221; Sheila remembered Dakota&#8217;s
statement that he had told no one of
their relations. So he <i>had</i> been talking, after
all! She was not surprised, but she was
undeniably angry and embarrassed to think
that perhaps all the time she had been talking
to Doubler he might have been appraising
her on the basis of her adventure with
Dakota.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he been saying?&#8221; she demanded
coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, ma&#8217;am. That is, nothin&#8217;
which any man wouldn&#8217;t say about you, once
he&#8217;d seen you an&#8217; talked some to you.&#8221;
Doubler surveyed her with sparkling, appreciative
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule it don&#8217;t pay to go to gossipin&#8217;
with anyone&mdash;least of all with a woman.
But I reckon I can tell you what he said,
ma&#8217;am, without you gettin&#8217; awful mad. He
didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; except that he&#8217;d taken an
awful shine to you. An&#8217; he&#8217;d likely make
things mighty unpleasant for me if he&#8217;d find
that I&#8217;d told you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shine?&#8221; There was a world of scornful
wonder in Sheila&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Would you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
mind telling me what &#8216;taking a shine&#8217; to
anyone means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, I reckon I don&#8217;t mind, ma&#8217;am,
seein&#8217; that it&#8217;s you. &#8216;Takin&#8217; a shine&#8217; to you
means that he&#8217;s some stuck on you&mdash;likes
you, that is. An&#8217; I reckon you can&#8217;t blame
him much for doin&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila did not answer, though a sudden
flood of red to her face made the use of mere
words entirely unnecessary so far as Doubler
was concerned, for he smiled wisely.</p>
<p>Sheila fled down the trail toward the crossing
without a parting word to Doubler,
leaving him standing at the door squinting
with amusement at her. But on the morrow
she had returned, determined to discover
something of Dakota, to learn something
of his history since coming into the
country, or at the least to see if she could
not induce Doubler to disclose his real name.</p>
<p>She was unsuccessful. Dakota had never
taken Doubler into his confidence, and the
information that she succeeded in worming
from the nester was not more than he had
already volunteered, or than Duncan had
given her that day when they were seated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
on the edge of the butte overlooking the
river.</p>
<p>She was convinced that Doubler had told
her all he knew, and she wondered at the
custom which permitted friendship on the
basis of such meager knowledge.</p>
<p>She quickly grew to like Doubler. He
showed a fatherly interest in her and always
greeted her with a smile when during
her rides she came to his cabin, or when she
met him, as she did frequently, on the open
range. His manner toward her was always
cordial, and he seemed not to have a care.
One morning, however, she rode up to the
door of the cabin and Doubler&#8217;s face was
serious. He stood quietly in the doorway,
watching her as she sat on her pony, not
offering to assist her down as he usually did,
and she knew instantly that something had
happened to disturb his peace of mind. He
did not invite her into the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, and Sheila detected
regret in his voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m a heap sorry, but
of course you won&#8217;t be comin&#8217; here any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why!&#8221; returned Sheila in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
surprise. &#8220;I like to come here. But, of
course, if you don&#8217;t want me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t that,&#8221; he interrupted quickly.
&#8220;I thought you knowed. But you don&#8217;t, of
course, or you wouldn&#8217;t have come just now.
Your dad an&#8217; Duncan was over to see me
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that,&#8221; returned Sheila.
&#8220;But I can&#8217;t see why a visit from father
should&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s wantin&#8217; me to pull my freight out
of the country,&#8221; said Doubler &#8220;An&#8217; of
course I ain&#8217;t doin&#8217; it. Therefore I&#8217;m severin&#8217;
diplomatic relations with your family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Sheila, puzzled
to understand why a mere visit on her
father&#8217;s part should have the result Doubler
had announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; Doubler told her.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a woman an&#8217; don&#8217;t understand
such things. But in this country when a
little owner has got some land which a big
owner wants&mdash;an&#8217; can&#8217;t buy&mdash;there&#8217;s likely
to be trouble. I ain&#8217;t proved on my land
yet, an&#8217; if your dad can run me off he&#8217;ll be
pretty apt to grab it somehow or other. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
he ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217; me off an&#8217; so there&#8217;s a heap
of trouble comin&#8217;. An&#8217; of course while
there&#8217;s trouble you won&#8217;t be comin&#8217; here any
more after this. Likely your dad wouldn&#8217;t
have it. I&#8217;m sorry, too. I like you a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why father should want your
land,&#8221; Sheila told him gravely, much disturbed
at this unexpected development.
&#8220;There is plenty of land here.&#8221; She swept
a hand toward the plains.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t enough for some people,&#8221;
grimly laughed Doubler. &#8220;Some people is
hawgs&mdash;askin&#8217; your pardon, ma&#8217;am. I
wasn&#8217;t expectin&#8217; your father to be like that,
after seein&#8217; you. I was hopin&#8217; that we&#8217;d be
able to get along. I&#8217;ve had some trouble
with Duncan&mdash;not very long ago. Once I
had to speak pretty plain to him. I expect
he&#8217;s been fillin&#8217; your dad up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see father about it.&#8221; Sheila&#8217;s face
was red with a pained embarrassment. &#8220;I
am sure that father will not make any
trouble for you&mdash;he isn&#8217;t that kind of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s that kind of a man, sure enough,&#8221;
said Doubler gravely. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve got
him sized up right. He ain&#8217;t in no way like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
you, ma&#8217;am. If you hadn&#8217;t told me I reckon
I wouldn&#8217;t have knowed he is your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my stepfather,&#8221; admitted Sheila.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed it!&#8221; declared Doubler. &#8220;I&#8217;m
too old to be fooled by what I see in a man&#8217;s
face&mdash;or in a woman&#8217;s face either. Don&#8217;t
you go to say anything about this business
to him. He&#8217;s bound to try to run me off.
He done said so. I don&#8217;t know when I ever
heard a man talk any meaner than he did.
Said that if I didn&#8217;t sell he&#8217;d make things
mighty unpleasant for me. An&#8217; so I reckon
there&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be some fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila did not remain long at Doubler&#8217;s
cabin, for her mind was in a riot of rage and
resentment against her father for his attitude
toward Doubler, and she cut short her
ride in the hope of being able to have a talk
with him before he left the ranchhouse. But
when she returned she was told by Duncan&#8217;s
sister that Langford had departed some
hours before&mdash;alone. He had not mentioned
his destination.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Ben Doubler had omitted an important
detail from his story of Langford&#8217;s visit to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
his cabin, for he had not cared to frighten
Sheila unnecessarily. But as Langford rode
toward Doubler&#8217;s cabin this morning his
thoughts persisted in dwelling on Doubler&#8217;s
final words to him, spoken as he and Duncan
had turned their horses to leave the
nester&#8217;s cabin the day before:</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be war, Langford, it ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to be no pussy-kitten affair. I&#8217;m
warnin&#8217; you to stay away from the Two
Forks. If I ketch you or any of your men
nosin&#8217; around there I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to bore you
some rapid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford had sneered then, and he
sneered now as he rode toward the river,
for he had no doubt that Doubler had uttered
the threat in a spirit of bravado. Of
course, he told himself as he rode, the man
was forced to say something, but the idea
of him being serious in the threat to shoot
any one who came to the Two Forks was
ridiculous.</p>
<p>All his life Langford had heard threats
from the lips of his victims, and thus far
they had remained only threats. He had
determined to see Doubler this morning, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
he had noticed that the nester had appeared
ill at ease in the presence of Duncan, and
he anticipated that alone he could force him
to accept terms. When he reached the
crossing at Two Forks he urged his pony
through its waters, his face wearing a confident
smile.</p>
<p>There was an open stretch of grass land
between the crossing and Doubler&#8217;s cabin,
and when Langford urged his pony up the
sloping bank of the river he saw the nester
standing near the door of the cabin, watching.
Langford was about to force his pony
to a faster pace, when he saw Doubler raise
a rifle to his shoulder. Still, he continued to
ride forward, but he pulled the pony up
shortly when he saw the flame spurt from
the muzzle of the rifle and heard the shrill
hiss of the bullet as it passed dangerously
near to him.</p>
<p>No words were needed, and neither man
spoke any. Without stopping to give
Doubler an opportunity to speak, Langford
wheeled his pony, and with a white,
scared face, bending low over the animal&#8217;s
mane to escape any bullets which might follow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the first, rapidly recrossed the river.
Once on the crest of the hill on the opposite
side he turned, and trembling with rage and
fear, shook a clenched hand at Doubler. The
latter&#8217;s reply was a strident laugh.</p>
<p>Langford returned to the ranchouse, riding
slowly, though in his heart was a riot of
rage and hatred against the nester. It was
war, to be sure. But now that Doubler had
shown in no unmistakable manner that he
had not been trifling the day before, Langford
was no longer in doubt as to the method
he would have to employ in his attempt to
gain possession of his land. Doubler, he
felt, had made the choice.</p>
<p>The ride to the ranchhouse took long, but
by the time Langford arrived there he had
regained his composure, saying nothing to
anyone concerning his adventure.</p>
<p>For three days he kept his own counsel,
riding out alone, taciturn, giving much
thought to the situation. Sheila had intended
to speak to him regarding the trouble
with Doubler, but his manner repulsed her
and she kept silent, hoping that the mood
would pass. However, the mood did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
pass. Langford continued to ride out alone,
maintaining a moody silence, sitting alone
much with his own thoughts and allowing
no one to break down the barrier of taciturnity
which he had erected.</p>
<p>On the morning of the fifth day after his
adventure with Doubler he was sitting on
the ranchhouse gallery with Duncan, enjoying
an after-breakfast cigar, when he said
casually to the latter:</p>
<p>"I take it that folks in this country are
mighty careless with their weapons."</p>
<p>Duncan grinned. "You might call it
careless," he returned. "No doubt there
are people&mdash;people who come out here from
the East&mdash;who think that a man who carries
a gun out here is careless with it. But I
reckon that when a man draws a gun here
he draws it with a pretty definite purpose."</p>
<p>"I have heard," continued Langford
slowly, "that there are men in this country
who do not hesitate to kill other people for
money."</p>
<p>"Meaning that there are road agents and
such?" questioned Duncan.</p>
<p>"Naturally, that particular kind would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
be included. I meant, however another
kind&mdash;I believe they are called &#8216;bad men,&#8217;
are they not? Men who kill for hire?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan cast a furtive glance at Langford
out of the corners of his eyes, but could
draw no conclusions concerning the latter&#8217;s
motive in asking the question from the expression
of his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such men drift in occasionally,&#8221; he returned,
convinced that Langford&#8217;s curiosity
was merely casual&mdash;as Langford desired
him to consider it. &#8220;Usually, though, they
don&#8217;t stay long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there are none of that breed
around here&mdash;in Lazette, for instance. It
struck me that Dakota was extraordinarily
handy with a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>He puffed long at his cigar and saw that,
though Duncan did not answer, his face had
grown suddenly dark with passion, as it always
did when Dakota&#8217;s name was mentioned.
Langford smiled subtly. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that Dakota might be called
a bad man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s eyes flashed with venom. &#8220;I
reckon Dakota&#8217;s nothing but a damned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
sneak!&#8221; he said, not being able to conceal
the bitterness in his voice.</p>
<p>Langford did not allow his smile to be
seen; he had not forgotten the incident of
the returning of Dakota&#8217;s horse by Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a dead shot, though,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m allowing that,&#8221; grudgingly returned
Duncan. &#8220;And,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it&#8217;s been
hinted that all his shooting scrapes haven&#8217;t
been on the level.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not straight, then?&#8221; said Langford,
his eyes gleaming. &#8220;Not &#8216;square,&#8217; as
you say in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there ain&#8217;t nothing square
about him,&#8221; returned Duncan, glad of an
opportunity to defame his enemy.</p>
<p>Again Langford did not allow Duncan to
see his smile, and he deftly directed the current
of the conversation into other channels.</p>
<p>He rode out again that day, taking the
river trail and passing Dakota&#8217;s cabin, but
Dakota himself was nowhere to be seen and
at dusk Langford returned to the Double R.
During the evening meal he enveloped himself
with a silence which proved impenetrable.
He retired early, to Duncan&#8217;s surprise,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
and the next morning, without announcing
his plans to anyone, saddled his
pony and rode away toward the river trail.</p>
<p>He took a circuitous route to reach it,
riding slowly, with the air and manner of a
man who is thinking deep thoughts, smiling
much, though many times grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota isn&#8217;t square,&#8221; he said once aloud
during one of his grim smiles.</p>
<p>When he came to the quicksand crossing
he halted and examined the earth in the
vicinity, smiling more broadly at the marks
and hoof prints in the hard sand near the
water&#8217;s edge. Then he rode on.</p>
<p>Two or three miles from the quicksand
crossing he came suddenly upon Dakota&#8217;s
cabin. Dakota himself was repairing a saddle
in the shade of the cabin wall, and for
all that Langford could see he was entirely
unaware of his approach. He saw Dakota
look up when he passed the corral gate, and
when he reached a point about twenty feet
distant he observed a faint smile on Dakota&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, stranger,&#8221; came the latter&#8217;s
voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, my friend?&#8221; greeted
Langford easily.</p>
<p>It was not hard for Langford to adopt an
air of familiarity toward the man who had
figured prominently in his thoughts during
a great many of the previous twenty-four
hours. He dismounted from his pony,
hitched the animal to a rail of the corral
fence, and approached Dakota, standing in
front of him and looking down at him with
a smile.</p>
<p>Dakota apparently took little interest in
his visitor, for keeping his seat on the box
upon which he had been sitting when Langford
had first caught sight of him, he continued
to give his attention to the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from the Double R,&#8221; offered Langford,
feeling slightly less important, conscious
that somehow the familiarity that he
had felt existed between them a moment before
was a singularly fleeting thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed that,&#8221; responded Dakota, still
busy with his saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that you&#8217;ve forgot that your
horse has got a brand on him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got keen eyes, my friend,&#8221;
laughed Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I?&#8221; Dakota had not looked at
Langford until now, and as he spoke he
raised his head and gazed fairly into the
latter&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>For a moment neither man moved or
spoke. It seemed to Langford, as he gazed
into the steely, fathomless blue of the eyes
which held his&mdash;held them, for now as he
looked it was the first time in his life that
his gaze had met a fellow being&#8217;s steadily&mdash;that
he could see there an unmistakable,
grim mockery. And that was all, for whatever
other emotions Dakota felt, they were
invisible to Langford. He drew a deep
breath, suddenly aware that before him was
a man exactly like himself in one respect&mdash;skilled
in the art of keeping his emotions to
himself. Langford had not met many such
men; usually he was able to see clear
through a man&mdash;able to read him. But this
man he could not read. He was puzzled
and embarrassed over the discovery. His
gaze finally wavered; he looked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man don&#8217;t have to have such terribly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
keen eyes to be able to see a brand,&#8221; observed
Dakota, drawling; &#8220;especially when he&#8217;s
passed a whole lot of his time looking at
brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Langford. &#8220;I suppose
you have been a cowboy a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Longer than you&#8217;ve been a ranch
owner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford looked quickly at Dakota, for
now the latter was again busy with his saddle,
but he could detect no sarcasm in his
face, though plainly there had been a subtle
quality of it in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know me?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t know you. I&#8217;ve put two
and two together. I heard that Duncan was
selling the Double R. I&#8217;ve seen your daughter.
And you ride up here on a Double R
horse. There ain&#8217;t no other strangers in the
country. Then, of course, you&#8217;re the new
owner of the Double R.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford looked again at the inscrutable
face of the man beside him and felt a sudden
deep respect for him. Even if he had not
witnessed the killing of Texas Blanca that
day in Lazette he would have known the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
man before him for what he was&mdash;a quiet,
cool, self-possessed man of much experience,
who could not be trifled with.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;I am the
new owner of the Double R. And I have
come, my friend, to thank you for what you
did for my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She told you, then?&#8221; Dakota&#8217;s gaze
was again on Langford, an odd light in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s told you what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How you rescued her from the quicksand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota&#8217;s gaze was still on his visitor,
quiet, intent. &#8220;She tell you anything else?&#8221;
he questioned slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what else is there to tell?&#8221; There
was sincere curiosity in Langford&#8217;s voice,
for Sheila had always told him everything
that happened to her. It was not like her
to keep anything secret from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she tell you that she forgot to thank
me for saving her?&#8221; There was a queer
smile on Dakota&#8217;s lips, a peculiar, pleased
glint in his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, she neglected to relate that,&#8221; returned
Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgot it. That&#8217;s what I thought. Do
you think she forgot it intentionally?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be like her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. And so she&#8217;s sent <i>you</i>
over to thank me! Tell her no thanks are
due. And if she inquires, tell her that the
pony didn&#8217;t make a sound or a struggle when
I shot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens, she didn&#8217;t send me,&#8221;
smiled Langford. &#8220;There was the excitement,
of course, and I presume she forgot
to thank you&mdash;possibly will ride over herself
some day to thank you personally. But she
didn&#8217;t send me&mdash;I came without her knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To thank me&mdash;for her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re visiting then. Or maybe just
riding around to look at your range. Sit
down.&#8221; He motioned to another box that
stood near the door of the cabin.</p>
<p>Once Langford became seated Dakota
again busied himself with the saddle, ignoring
his visitor. Langford shifted uneasily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
on the box, for the seat was not to his liking
and the attitude of his host was most peculiar.
He fell silent also and kicked
gravely and absently into a hummock with
the toe of his boot.</p>
<p>Singularly enough, a plan which had
taken form in his mind since Doubler had
shot at him seemed suddenly to have many
defects, though until now it had seemed
complete enough. Out of the jumble of
thoughts that had rioted in his brain after
his departure from Two Forks crossing had
risen a conviction. Doubler was a danger
and a menace and must be removed. And
there was no legal way to remove him,
for though he had not proved on his land he
was entitled to it to the limit set by the law,
or until his death.</p>
<p>Langford&#8217;s purpose in questioning Duncan
had been to learn of the presence of
someone in the country who would not be
averse to removing Doubler. The possibility
of disposing of the nester in this manner
had been before him ever since he had
learned of his presence on the Two Forks.
He had not been surprised when Duncan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
had mentioned Dakota as being a probable
tool, for he had thought over the occurrence
of the shooting in Lazette many times, and
had been much impressed with Dakota&#8217;s
coolness and his satanic cleverness with a
six-shooter, and it seemed that it would be
a simple matter to arrange with him for the
removal of Doubler. Yes, it had seemed
simple enough when he had planned it, and
when Duncan had told him that Dakota was
not on the &#8220;square.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now, looking covertly at the man, he
found that he was not quite certain in spite
of what Duncan had said. He had mentally
worked out his plan of approaching Dakota
many times. But now the defect in the plan
seemed to be that he had misjudged his man&mdash;that
Duncan had misjudged him. Plainly
he would make a mistake were he to approach
Dakota with a bold request for the
removing of the nester&mdash;he must clothe it.
Thus, after a long silence, he started
obliquely.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it must be lonesome
out here for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so lonesome.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big country, though&mdash;lots of land.
There seems to be no end to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s plenty of it. I
reckon the Lord wasn&#8217;t in a stingy mood
when he made it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet there seem to be restrictions even
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Restrictions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Langford; &#8220;restrictions
on a man&#8217;s desires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota looked at him with a saturnine
smile. &#8220;Restrictions on a man&#8217;s desires,&#8221;
he repeated slowly. Then he laughed mirthlessly.
&#8220;Some people wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied
if they owned the whole earth. They&#8217;d be
wanting the sun, moon, and stars thrown in
for good measure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford laughed again. &#8220;That&#8217;s human
nature, my friend,&#8221; he contended, determined
not to be forced to digress from the
main subject. &#8220;Have you got everything
you want? Isn&#8217;t there anything besides
what you already have that appeals to you?
Have you no ambition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are plenty of things I want.
Maybe I&#8217;d be modest, though, if I had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
ambition. We all want a lot of things which
we can&#8217;t get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct, my friend. Some of us want
money, others desire happiness, still others
are after something else. As you say, some
of use are never satisfied&mdash;the ambitious
ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are ambitious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve struck it,&#8221; smiled Langford.</p>
<p>Dakota caught his gaze, and there was a
smile of derision on his lips. &#8220;What particular
thing are <i>you</i> looking for?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine?&#8221; Dakota&#8217;s lips curled a little.
&#8220;Doubler&#8217;s, then,&#8221; he added as Langford
shook his head with an emphatic, negative
motion. &#8220;He&#8217;s the only man who&#8217;s got
land near yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s correct,&#8221; admitted Langford;
&#8220;I want Doubler&#8217;s land.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence for a few minutes,
while Langford watched Dakota furtively
as the latter gave his entire attention to his
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got all the rest of those things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
you spoke about, then&mdash;happiness, money,
and such?&#8221; said Dakota presently, in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I am pretty well off there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All you want is Doubler&#8217;s land?&#8221; He
stopped working with the saddle and looked
at Langford. &#8220;I reckon, if you&#8217;ve got all
those things, that you ought to be satisfied.
But of course you ain&#8217;t satisfied, or you
wouldn&#8217;t want Doubler&#8217;s land. Did you
offer to buy it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked him to name his own figure, and
he wouldn&#8217;t sell&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t even consider
selling, though I offered him what I considered
a fair price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s odd, isn&#8217;t it? You&#8217;d naturally
think that money could buy everything.
But maybe Doubler has found happiness
on his land. You couldn&#8217;t buy that from
a man, you know. I suppose you care a
lot about Doubler&#8217;s happiness&mdash;you
wouldn&#8217;t want to take his land if you knew
he was happy on it? Or don&#8217;t it make any
difference to you?&#8221; There was faint sarcasm
in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens,&#8221; said Langford, reddening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
a little, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t a question of happiness&mdash;it
is merely business. Doubler&#8217;s land
adjoins mine. I want to extend my holdings.
I can&#8217;t extend in Doubler&#8217;s direction
because Doubler controls the water rights.
Therefore it is my business to see that
Doubler gets out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And sentiment has got no place in business.
That right? It doesn&#8217;t make any difference
to you that Doubler doesn&#8217;t want to
sell; you want his land, and that settles it&mdash;so
far as you are concerned. You don&#8217;t
consider Doubler&#8217;s feelings. Well, I don&#8217;t
know but that&#8217;s the way things are run&mdash;one
man keeps what he can and another
gets what he is able to get. What are you
figuring to do about Doubler?&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford glanced at Dakota with an
oily, significant smile. &#8220;I am new to the
country, my friend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know anything about the usual custom employed
to force a man to give up his land.
Could you suggest anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota deliberately took up a wax-end,
rolled it, and squinted his eyes as he forced
the end of the thread through the eye of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
needle which he held in the other hand. So
far as Langford could see he exhibited no
emotion whatever; his face was inscrutable;
he might not have heard.</p>
<p>Yet Langford knew that he had heard;
was certain that he grasped the full meaning
of the question; probably felt some emotion
over it, and was masking it by appearing
to busy himself with the saddle. Langford&#8217;s
respect for him grew and he wisely
kept silent, knowing that in time Dakota
would answer. But when the answer did
come it was not the one that Langford expected.
Dakota&#8217;s eyes met his in a level
gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you shoot him yourself?&#8221;
he said, drawling his words a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not taking any chances?&#8221; Dakota&#8217;s
voice was filled with a cold sarcasm as he
continued, after an interval during which
Langford kept a discreetly still tongue.
&#8220;Your business principles don&#8217;t take you
quite that far, eh? And so you&#8217;ve come over
to get me to shoot him? Why didn&#8217;t you
say so in the beginning&mdash;it would have
saved all this time.&#8221; He laughed coldly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that you could hire
me to put Doubler out of business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you shoot Blanca,&#8221; said Langford.
&#8220;And I sounded Duncan.&#8221; It did
not disturb him to discover that Dakota had
all along been aware of the object of his
visit. It rather pleased him, in fact, to be
given proof of the man&#8217;s discernment&mdash;it
showed that he was deep and clever.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw me shoot Blanca,&#8221; said Dakota
with a strange smile, &#8220;and Duncan told
you I was the man to put Doubler away.
Those are my recommendations.&#8221; His
voice was slightly ironical, almost concealing
a slight harshness. &#8220;Did Duncan mention
that he was a friend of mine?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;No?&#8221; His smile grew mocking.
&#8220;Just merely mentioned that I was uncommonly
clever in the art of getting people&mdash;undesirable
people&mdash;out of the way. Don&#8217;t
get the idea, though, because Duncan told
you, that I make a business of shooting
folks. I put Blanca out of the way because
it was a question of him or me&mdash;I shot him
to save my own hide. Shooting Doubler
would be quite another proposition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Still&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He looked at Langford, his
eyes narrowing and smoldering with a
mysterious fire.</p>
<p>It seemed that he was inviting Langford
to make a proposal, and the latter smiled
evilly. &#8220;Still,&#8221; he said, repeating Dakota&#8217;s
word with a significant inflection,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t refuse to listen to me. It would
be worth a thousand dollars to me to have
Doubler out of the way,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>It was out now, and Langford sat silent
while Dakota gazed into the distance that
reached toward the nester&#8217;s cabin. Langford
watched Dakota closely, but there was
an absolute lack of expression in the latter&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you offering to pay the thousand?&#8221;
questioned Dakota. &#8220;And when?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In cash, when Doubler isn&#8217;t here any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota looked up at him, his face a mask
of immobility. &#8220;That <i>sounds</i> all right,&#8221; he
said, with slow emphasis. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll
put it in writing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford&#8217;s eyes narrowed; he smiled
craftily. &#8220;That,&#8221; he said smoothly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
&#8220;would put me in your power. I have
never been accused of being a fool by any
of the men with whom I have done business.
Don&#8217;t you think that at my age it
is a little late to start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we don&#8217;t make any deal,&#8221;
laughed Dakota shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll arrange it this way,&#8221; suggested
Langford. &#8220;Doubler is not the only man
I want to get rid of. I want your land,
too. But&#8221;&mdash;he added as he saw Dakota&#8217;s
lips harden&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t purpose to proceed
against you in the manner I am dealing
with Doubler. I flatter myself that I know
men quite well. I&#8217;d like to buy your land.
What would be a fair price for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll put it this way, then,&#8221; said Langford,
briskly and silkily. &#8220;I will give you
an agreement worded in this manner: &#8216;One
month after date I promise to pay to Dakota
the sum of six thousand dollars, in consideration
of his rights and interest in the
Star brand, provided that within one month
from date he persuades Ben Doubler to
leave Union county.&#8217;&#8221; He looked at Dakota
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
with a significant smile. &#8220;You see,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that I am not particularly desirous
of being instrumental in causing Doubler&#8217;s
death&mdash;you have misjudged me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota&#8217;s eyes met his with a glance of
perfect knowledge. His smile possessed a
subtly mocking quality&mdash;which was slightly
disconcerting to Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll be an angel&mdash;give you
time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am accepting that
proposition, though,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been wanting to leave here&mdash;I&#8217;ve got tired
of it. And&#8221;&mdash;he continued with a mysterious
smile&mdash;&#8220;if things turn out as I expect,
you&#8217;ll be glad to have me go.&#8221; He
rose from the bench. &#8220;Let&#8217;s write that
agreement,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>They entered the cabin, and a few minutes
later Dakota sat again on the box in
the lee of the cabin wall, mending his saddle,
the signed agreement in his pocket. Smiling,
Langford rode the river trail, satisfied
with the result of his visit. Turning once&mdash;as
he reached the rise upon which Sheila
had halted that morning after leaving Dakota&#8217;s
cabin, Langford looked back. Dakota
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
was still busy with his saddle. Langford
urged his pony down the slope of the
rise and vanished from view. Then Dakota
ceased working on the saddle, drew out the
signed agreement and read it through many
times.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man,&#8221; he said finally, looking toward
the crest of the slope where Langford
had disappeared, &#8220;thinks he has convinced
me that I ought to kill my best friend. He
hasn&#8217;t changed a bit&mdash;not a damned bit!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>DUNCAN ADDS TWO AND TWO</h3>
</div>

<p>Had Langford known that there had
been a witness to his visit to Dakota
he might not have ridden away
from the latter&#8217;s cabin so entirely satisfied
with the result of his interview.</p>
<p>Duncan had been much interested in
Langford&#8217;s differences with Doubler. He
had agitated the trouble, and he fully expected
Langford to take him into his confidence
should any aggressive movement be
contemplated. He had even expected to be
allowed to plan the details of the scheme
which would have as its object the downfall
of the nester, for thus he hoped to satisfy
his personal vengeance against the latter.</p>
<p>But since the interview with Doubler
at Doubler&#8217;s cabin, Langford had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
strangely silent regarding his plans. Not
once had he referred to the nester, and his
silence had nettled Duncan. Langford had
ignored his hints, had returned monosyllabic
replies to his tentative questions, causing
the manager to appear to be an outsider
in an affair in which he felt a vital interest.</p>
<p>It was annoying, to say the least, and
Duncan&#8217;s nature rebelled against the slight,
whether intentional or accidental. He had
waited patiently until the morning following
his conversation with Langford about
Dakota, certain that the Double R owner
would speak, but when after breakfast the
next morning Langford had ridden away
without breaking his silence, the manager
had gone into the ranchhouse, secured his
field glasses, mounted his pony, and followed.</p>
<p>He kept discreetly in the rear, lingering
in the depressions, skirting the bases of the
hills, concealing himself in draws and behind
boulders&mdash;never once making the mistake
of appearing on the skyline. And
when Langford was sitting on the box in
front of Dakota&#8217;s cabin, the manager was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
deep into the woods that surrounded the
clearing where the cabin stood, watching
intently through his field glasses.</p>
<p>He saw Langford depart, remained after
his departure to see Dakota repeatedly read
the signed agreement. Of course, he was
entirely ignorant of what had transpired,
but there was little doubt in his mind that
the two had reached some sort of an understanding.
That their conversation and
subsequent agreement concerned Doubler
he had little doubt either, for fresh in his
mind was a recollection of his conversation
with Langford, distinguished by Langford&#8217;s
carefully guarded questions regarding
Dakota&#8217;s ability with the six-shooter.
He felt that Langford was deliberately
leaving him out of the scheme, whatever it
was.</p>
<p>Puzzled and raging inwardly over the
slight, Duncan did not return to the ranchhouse
that day and spent the night at one
of the line camps. The following day he
rode in to the ranchhouse to find that Langford
had gone out riding with Sheila. Morose,
sullen, Duncan again rode abroad, returning
with the dusk. In his conversation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
with Langford that night the Double R
owner made no reference to Doubler, and,
studying Sheila, Duncan thought she
seemed depressed.</p>
<p>During her ride that day with her father
Sheila had received a startling revelation of
his character. She had questioned him regarding
his treatment of Doubler, ending
with a plea for justice for the latter. For
the first time during all the time she had
known Langford she had seen an angry intolerance
in his eyes, and though his voice
had been as bland and smooth as ever, it
did not heal the wound which had been
made in her heart over the discovery that
he could feel impatient with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Sheila,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I should
regret to find that you are interested in my
business affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubler declares that you are unjust,&#8221;
she persisted, determined to do her best to
avert the trouble that seemed impending.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubler is an obstacle in the path of
progress and will get the consideration he
deserves,&#8221; he said shortly. &#8220;Please do not
meddle with what does not concern you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus had an idol which Sheila worshiped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
been tumbled from its pedestal. Sheila surveyed
it, lying shattered at her feet, with
moist eyes. It might be restored, patched
so that it would resemble its original shape,
but never again would it appear the same in
her eyes. She had received a glimpse of her
father&#8217;s real character; she saw the merciless,
designing, real man stripped of the
polished veneer that she had admired; his
soul lay naked before her, seared and rendered
unlovely by the blackness of deceit
and trickery.</p>
<p>As the days passed, however, she collected
the fragments of the shattered idol and
began to replace them. Piece by piece she
fitted them together, cementing them with
her faith, so that in time the idol resembled
its original shape.</p>
<p>She had been too exacting, she told herself.
Men had ways of dealing with one
another which women could not understand.
Her ideas of justice were tempered with
mercy and pity; she allowed her heart to
map out her line of conduct toward her
fellow men, and as a consequence her sympathies
were broad and tender. In business,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
though, she supposed, it must be different.
There mind must rule. It was a
struggle in which the keenest wit and the
sharpest instinct counted, and in which the
emotion of mercy was subordinate to the
love of gain. And so in time she erected
her idol again and the cracks and seams in
it became almost invisible.</p>
<p>While she had been restoring her idol
there had been other things to occupy her
mind. A thin line divides tragedy from
comedy, and after the tragedy of discovering
her father&#8217;s real character Sheila longed
for something to take her mind out of the
darkness. A recollection of Duncan&#8217;s jealousy,
which he had exhibited on the day
that she had related the story of her rescue
by Dakota, still abided with her, and convinced
that she might secure diversion by
fanning the spark that she had discovered,
she began by inducing Duncan to ask her
to ride with him.</p>
<p>Sitting on the grass one day in the shade
of some fir-balsams on a slope several miles
down the river, Sheila looked at Duncan
with a smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that I am beginning to like
the country,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected you would like it after you
were here a while. Everybody does. It
grows into one. If you ever go back East
you will never be contented&mdash;you&#8217;ll be
dreaming and longing. The West improves
on acquaintance, like the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning?&#8221; she said, with a defiant
mockery so plain in her eyes that Duncan
drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that you ought to begin to
like us&mdash;the people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I do like some of the people,&#8221;
she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance,&#8221; he said, his face reddening
a little.</p>
<p>She looked at him with a taunting smile.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that I like you&mdash;so very
well. You get too cross when things don&#8217;t
suit you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are mistaken,&#8221; he challenged.
&#8220;When have I been cross?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila laughed. &#8220;Do you remember the
night that I came home and told you and
father how Dakota had rescued me from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
the quicksand? Well,&#8221; she continued, noting
his nod and the frown which accompanied
it, &#8220;you were cross that night&mdash;almost
boorish. You moped and went off
to bed without saying good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>It pleased Duncan to tell her that he
had forgotten if he had ever acted that way,
and she did not press him. And so a silence
fell between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you were beginning to like
some of the people,&#8221; said Duncan presently.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t like me. Then who do you
like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, appearing to meditate,
but in reality watching him closely so that
she might catch his gaze when he looked up.
&#8220;There&#8217;s Ben Doubler. He seems to be a
very nice old man. And&#8221;&mdash;Duncan looked
at her and she met his gaze fairly, her eyes
dancing with mischief&mdash;&#8220;and Dakota. He
is a character, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan frowned darkly and removed his
gaze from her face, directing it down into
the plain on the other side of the river.
What strange fatality had linked her sympathies
and admiration with his enemies?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
A rage which he dared not let her see seized
him, and he sat silent, clenching and unclenching
his hands.</p>
<p>She saw his condition and pressed him
without mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>is</i> a character, isn&#8217;t he? An odd
one, but attractive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan sneered. &#8220;He pulled you out of
the quicksand, of course. Anybody could
have done that, if they&#8217;d been around. I
reckon that&#8217;s what makes him &#8216;attractive&#8217;
in your eyes. On the other hand, he put
Texas Blanca out of business. Does that
killing help to make him attractive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t Blanca his enemy. If you remember,
you told father and me that
Blanca sold him some stolen cattle. Then,
according to what I have heard of the story,
he met Blanca in Lazette, ordered him to
leave, and when he didn&#8217;t go he shot him.
I understand that that is the code in matters
of that sort&mdash;people have to take the
law in their own hands. But he gave
Blanca the opportunity to shoot first.
Wasn&#8217;t that fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed odd to her that she was defending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
the man who had wronged her, yet
strangely enough she discovered that defending
him gave her a thrill of satisfaction,
though she assured herself that the satisfaction
came from the fact that she was
engaged in the task of arousing Duncan&#8217;s
jealousy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been inquiring about him,
then?&#8221; said Duncan, his face dark with
rage and hatred. &#8220;What I told you about
that calf deal is the story that Dakota himself
tells about it. A lot of people in this
country don&#8217;t believe Dakota&#8217;s story. They
believe what I believe, that Dakota and
Blanca were in partnership on that deal,
and that Dakota framed up that story
about Blanca selling out to him to avert
suspicion. It&#8217;s likely that they wised up to
the fact that we were on to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you mentioned your suspicions
to Dakota himself, didn&#8217;t you? The
day you went over after the calves? You
had quite a talk with him about them, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; said Sheila, sweetly.</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s face whitened. &#8220;Who told
you that?&#8221; he demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And he told you that if you ever interfered
with him again, or that if he heard of
you repeating your suspicions to anyone, he
would do something to you&mdash;run you out
of the country, or something like that, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; repeated Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubler told me,&#8221; returned Sheila with
a smile.</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s face worked with impotent
wrath as he looked at her. &#8220;So Doubler&#8217;s
been gassing again?&#8221; he said with a sneer.
&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s never been any love lost between
Doubler and me, and so what he says
don&#8217;t amount to much.&#8221; He laughed oddly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s strange to think how thick you are
with Doubler,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I understand that
your dad and Doubler ain&#8217;t exactly on a
friendly footing, that your dad was trying
to buy him out and that he won&#8217;t sell.
There&#8217;s likely to be trouble, for your dad is
determined to get Doubler&#8217;s land.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, that was a subject upon which
Sheila did not care to dwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that I am interested in
that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I presume that father is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
able to take care of his own affairs without
any assistance from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s eyes lighted with interest. Her
words showed that she was aware of Langford&#8217;s
differences with the nester. Probably
her father had told her&mdash;taking her
into his confidence while ignoring his manager.
Perhaps he had even told her of his
visit to Dakota; perhaps there had been
more than one visit and Sheila had accompanied
him. Undoubtedly, he told himself,
Sheila&#8217;s admiration for Dakota had resulted
from not one, but many, meetings. He
flushed at the thought, and was forced to
look away from Sheila for fear that she
might see the passion that flamed in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seen Dakota lately?&#8221; he questioned,
after he had regained sufficient control
of himself to be able to speak quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Sheila was flecking some dust
from her skirts with her riding whip, and
her manner was one of absolute lack of interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ain&#8217;t been riding with your
father?&#8221; said Duncan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221; Sheila continued to brush the
dust from her skirts. After answering Duncan&#8217;s
question, however, she realized that
there had been a subtle undercurrent of
meaning in his voice, and she turned and
looked sharply at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Do you mean
that father has visited Dakota?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;m meaning just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila did not like the expression in Duncan&#8217;s
eyes, and her chin was raised a little
as she turned from him and gave her attention
to flecking the grass near her with the
lash of her riding whip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father attends to his own business,&#8221; she
said with some coldness, for she resented
Duncan&#8217;s apparent desire to interfere. &#8220;I
told you that before. What he does in a
business way does not interest me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; said Duncan mockingly. &#8220;Well,
he&#8217;s made some sort of a deal with Dakota!&#8221;
he snapped, aware of his lack of wisdom in
telling her this, but unable to control his resentment
over the slight which had been imposed
on him by Langford, and by her own
chilling manner, which seemed to emphasize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
the fact that he had been left outside their
intimate councils.</p>
<p>&#8220;A deal?&#8221; said Sheila quickly, unable to
control her interest.</p>
<p>For a moment he did not answer. He
felt her gaze upon him, and he met it, smiling
mysteriously. Under the sudden necessity
of proving his statement, his thoughts
centered upon the conclusion which had resulted
from his suspicions&mdash;that Langford&#8217;s
visit to Dakota concerned Doubler. Equivocation
would have taken him safely away
from the pitfall into which his rash words
had almost plunged him, but he felt that
any evasion now would only bring scorn into
the eyes which he wished to see alight with
something else. Besides, here was an opportunity
to speak a derogatory word about
his enemy, and he could not resist&mdash;could
not throw it carelessly aside. There was a
venomous note in his voice when he finally
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;The other day your father was speaking
to me about gun-men. I told him that Dakota
would do anything for money.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slow red appeared in Sheila&#8217;s cheeks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
mounted to her temples, disappeared entirely
and was succeeded by a paleness. She
kept her gaze averted, and Duncan could
not see her eyes&mdash;they were turned toward
the slumberous plains that stretched away
into the distance on the other side of the
river. But Duncan knew that he had scored,
and was not bothered over the possibility of
there being little truth in his implied charge.
He watched her, gloating over her, certain
that at a stroke he had effectually eliminated
Dakota as a rival.</p>
<p>Sheila turned suddenly to him. &#8220;How
do you know that Dakota would do anything
like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan smiled as he saw her lips, straight
and white, and tightening coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know?&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;How
does a man know anything in this country?
By using his eyes, of course. I&#8217;ve used
mine. I&#8217;ve watched Dakota for five years.
I&#8217;ve known all along that he isn&#8217;t on the
square&mdash;that he has been running his branding
iron on other folks&#8217; cattle. I&#8217;ve told you
that he worked a crooked deal on me, and
then sent Blanca over the divide when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
thought there was a chance of Blanca giving
the deal away. I am told that when he
met Blanca in the Red Dog Blanca told him
plainly that he didn&#8217;t know anything about
the calf deal. That shows how he treats his
friends. He&#8217;ll do anything for money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other day I saw your father at his
cabin, talking to him. They had quite a
confab. Your father has had trouble with
Doubler&mdash;you know that. He has threatened
to run Doubler off the Two Forks. I
heard that myself. He wouldn&#8217;t try to run
Doubler off himself&mdash;that&#8217;s too dangerous
a business for him to undertake. Not wanting
to take the chance himself he hires someone
else. Who? Dakota&#8217;s the only gunman
around these parts. Therefore, your
dad goes to Dakota. He and Dakota signed
a paper&mdash;I saw Dakota reading it. I&#8217;ve
just put two and two together, and that&#8217;s
the result. I reckon I ain&#8217;t far out of the
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila laughed as she might have laughed
had someone told her that she herself had
plotted to murder Doubler&mdash;a laugh full of
scorn and mockery. Yet in her eyes, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
were wide with horror, and in her face, which
was suddenly drawn and white, was proof
that Duncan&#8217;s words had hurt her mortally.</p>
<p>She was silent; she did not offer to defend
Dakota, for in her thoughts still lingered a
recollection of the scene of the shooting in
Lazette. And when she considered her
father&#8217;s distant manner toward her and
Ben Doubler&#8217;s grave prediction of trouble,
it seemed that perhaps Duncan was right.
Yet in spite of the shooting of Blanca and
the evil light which was now thrown on Dakota
through Duncan&#8217;s deductions, she felt
confident that Dakota would not become a
party to a plot in which the murder of a
man was deliberately planned. He had
wronged her and he had killed a man, but
at the quicksand crossing that day&mdash;despite
the rage which had been in her heart against
him&mdash;she had studied him and had become
convinced that behind his recklessness, back
of the questionable impulses that seemed at
times to move him, there lurked qualities
which were wholly admirable, and which
could be felt by anyone who came in contact
with him. Certainly those qualities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
which she had seen had not been undiscovered
by Duncan&mdash;and others.</p>
<p>She remembered now that on a former
occasion the manager had practically admitted
his fear of Dakota, and then there
was his conduct on that day when she had
asked him to return Dakota&#8217;s pony. Duncan&#8217;s
manner then had seemed to indicate
that he feared Dakota&mdash;at the least did not
like him. Ben Doubler had given her a different
version of the trouble between Dakota
and Duncan; how Duncan had accused
Dakota of stealing the Double R calves, and
how in the presence of Duncan&#8217;s own men
Dakota had forced him to apologize. Taken
altogether, it seemed that Duncan&#8217;s present
suspicions were the result of his dislike, or
fear, of Dakota. Convinced of this, her
eyes flashed with contempt when she looked
at the manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are lying,&#8221; she said coldly.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t like Dakota. But I have faith
in him&mdash;in his manhood. I don&#8217;t believe
that any man who has the courage to force
another man to apologize to him in the face
of great odds, would, or could, be so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
entirely base as to plan to murder a
poor, unoffending old man in cold blood.
Perhaps you are not lying,&#8221; she concluded
with straight lips, &#8220;but the very least that
can be said for you is that you have a lurid
imagination!&#8221;</p>
<p>In Duncan&#8217;s gleaming, shifting eyes, in
the lips which were tensed over his teeth in
a snarl, she could see the bitterness that was
in his heart over the incident to which she
had just referred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said smiling evilly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
know more about Dakota before long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila rose and walked to her pony,
mounting the animal and riding slowly away
from the river. She did not see the queer
smile on Duncan&#8217;s face as she rode, but looking
back at the distance of a hundred yards,
she saw that he did not intend to follow her.
He was still sitting where she had left him,
his back to her, his face turned toward the
plains which spread away toward Dakota&#8217;s
cabin, twenty miles down the river.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A PARTING AND A VISIT</h3>
</div>

<p>The problem which filled Duncan&#8217;s
mind as he sat on the edge of the
slope overlooking the river was a
three-sided one. To reach a conclusion the
emotions of fear, hatred, and jealousy would
have to be considered in the light of their
relative importance.</p>
<p>There was, for example, his fear of Dakota,
which must be taken into account when
he meditated any action prompted by his
jealousy, and his fear of Dakota was a
check on his desires, a damper which must
control the heat of his emotions. He might
hate Dakota, but his fear of him would prevent
his taking any action which might expose
his own life to risk. On the other hand,
jealousy urged him to accept any risk; it
kept telling him over and over that he was
a fool to allow Dakota to live. But Duncan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
knew better than to attempt an open
clash with Dakota; each time that he had
looked into Dakota&#8217;s eyes he had seen there
something which told him plainer than
words of his own inferiority&mdash;that he would
have no chance in a man-to-man encounter
with him. And his latest experience with
Dakota had proved that.</p>
<p>However, Duncan&#8217;s character would not
permit him to concede defeat, and his revenge
was not a thing to be considered
lightly. Therefore, though he sat for a long
time on the slope, meditating over his problem,
in the end he smiled. It was not a good
smile to see, for his eyes were alight with a
crafty, designing gleam, and there was a
cruel curve in the lines of his lips. When
he finally mounted his pony and rode away
from the slope he was whistling.</p>
<p>During the next few days he did not see
much of Sheila, for he avoided the ranchhouse
as much as possible. He rode out with
Langford many times, and though he covertly
questioned the Double R owner concerning
the affair with Doubler he could
gain no satisfying information. Langford&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
reticence further aggravated the passions
which rioted in his heart, and finally one
afternoon when they rode up to the ranchhouse
his curiosity could be held in check no
longer, and he put the blunt question:</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done about Doubler?&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford&#8217;s shifting eyes rested for the
fraction of a second on the face of his manager,
and then the old, bland smile came into
his own and he answered smoothly: &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been thinking,&#8221; said Duncan
carelessly, but with a sharp side glance at
his employer, &#8220;that it wouldn&#8217;t be a half
bad idea to set a gunman on Doubler&mdash;a
man like Dakota, for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The manager saw Langford&#8217;s lips
straighten a little, and his eyes flashed with
a sudden fire. The expression on Langford&#8217;s
face strengthened the conviction already
in Duncan&#8217;s mind concerning the motive
of his employer&#8217;s visit to Dakota.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I care to have any dealings
with Dakota,&#8221; said Langford shortly.</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s eyes blazed again. &#8220;I reckon
if you&#8217;d go talk to him,&#8221; he persisted, turning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
his head so that Langford could not see
the suppressed rage in his eyes, &#8220;you might
be able to make a deal with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to deal with him. I have
decided not to bother Doubler at present.
And I have no desire to talk with Dakota.
Frankly, my dear Duncan, I don&#8217;t like the
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You been in the habit of forming opinions
of men you&#8217;ve never talked to?&#8221; said
Duncan. He could not keep the sneer out
of his voice.</p>
<p>Langford noticed it and laughed softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my recollection that a certain man
of my acquaintance advised me at length of
Dakota&#8217;s shortcomings,&#8221; he said significantly.
&#8220;For me to talk to Dakota after
that would be to consider this man&#8217;s words
valueless. I will have nothing to do with
Dakota. That is,&#8221; he added, &#8220;unless you
have altered your opinion of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan did not reply, and he said nothing
more to Langford on the subject, but he
had discovered that for some reason Langford
had chosen to keep the knowledge of
his visit to Dakota secret, and Duncan&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
suspicions that the visit concerned Doubler
became a conviction. Filled with resentment
over Langford&#8217;s attitude toward him,
and with his mind definitely fixed upon the
working out of his problem, Duncan decided
to visit Doubler.</p>
<p>He chose a day when Langford had ridden
away to a distant cow camp, and as
when he was following the Double R owner,
he did not ride the beaten trail but kept behind
the ridges and in the depressions, and
when he came within sight of Doubler&#8217;s
cabin he halted to reconnoiter. A swift survey
of the corral showed him a rangy, piebald
pony, which he knew to belong to Dakota.
As the animal had on a bridle and a
saddle he surmised that Dakota&#8217;s visit would
not be of long duration, and having no desire
to visit Doubler in the presence of his
rival, he shunted his own horse off the edge
of a sand dune and down into the bed of a
dry arroyo. Urging the animal along this,
he presently reached a sand flat on whose
edge arose a grove of fir-balsam and cottonwood.</p>
<p>For an hour, deep in the grove, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
watched the cabin, and at length he saw Dakota
come out; saw a smile on his face;
heard him laugh. His lips writhed at the
sound, and he listened intently to catch the
conversation which was carried on between
the two men, but the distance was too great.
However, he was able to judge from the actions
of the two that their relations were decidedly
friendly, and this discovery immediately
raised a doubt in his mind as to the
correctness of his deductions.</p>
<p>Yet the doubt did not seriously affect his
determination to carry out the plan he had
in mind, and when a few moments after
coming out of the cabin, Dakota departed
down the river trail, Duncan slowly rode
out of the grove and approached the cabin.</p>
<p>Doubler stood in the open doorway, looking
after Dakota, and when the latter finally
disappeared around a bend in the river the
nester turned and saw Duncan. Instantly
he stepped inside the cabin door, reappearing
immediately, holding a rifle. Duncan
continued to ride forward, raising one hand,
with the palm toward Doubler, as a sign of
the peacefulness of his intentions. The latter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
permitted him to approach, though he
held the rifle belligerently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk,&#8221; said Duncan, when he
had come near enough to make himself
heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull up right where you are, then,&#8221;
commanded Doubler. He was silent while
Duncan drew his pony to a halt and sat motionless
in the saddle looking at him. Then
his voice came with a truculent snap:</p>
<p>&#8220;You alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your new boss?&#8221; sarcastically
inquired Doubler. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you scared he&#8217;ll
git lost&mdash;runnin&#8217; around alone without anyone
to look after him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t his keeper,&#8221; returned Duncan
shortly.</p>
<p>Doubler laughed unbelievingly. &#8220;You
was puttin&#8217; in a heap of your time bein&#8217; his
keeper, the last I saw of you,&#8221; he declared
coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe I was. We&#8217;ve had a falling
out.&#8221; The venom in Duncan&#8217;s voice was
not at all pretended. &#8220;He&#8217;s double crossed
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Double crossed you?&#8221; There was disbelief
and suspicion in Doubter&#8217;s laugh.
&#8220;How&#8217;s he done that? I reckoned you was
too smart for anyone to do that to you?&#8221;
The sarcasm in this last brought a dark red
into Duncan&#8217;s face, but he successfully concealed
his resentment and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
more than that coming from you. I&#8217;m telling
you about what he done to me if you
ain&#8217;t got any objections to me getting off
my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me from where you are.&#8221; In spite
of the coldness in the nester&#8217;s voice there
was interest in his eyes. &#8220;Mebbe you an&#8217;
him have had a fallin&#8217; out, but I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217;
any chances on you bein&#8217; my friend&mdash;not a
durned chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I don&#8217;t blame you for not
wanting to take a chance, and I&#8217;m not pretending
to be your friend. And I sure ain&#8217;t
any friendly to Langford. He&#8217;s double
crossed me, but I ain&#8217;t telling how he done
it&mdash;that&#8217;s between him and me. But I want
to tell you something that will interest you
a whole lot. It&#8217;s about some guy which is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
trying to double cross you. To prove that
I ain&#8217;t thinking to plug you when you ain&#8217;t
looking I&#8217;m leaving my gun here.&#8221; He
drew out his six-shooter and stuck it behind
his slicker, dismounted, and threw the reins
over the pony&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>In silence Doubler suffered him to approach,
though he kept his rifle ready in his
hand and his eyes still continued to wear a
belligerent expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and me ain&#8217;t been what you might
call friendly for a long time,&#8221; offered Duncan
when he had halted a few feet from
Doubler. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had words, but I&#8217;ve
never tried to take any mean advantage of
you&mdash;which I might have done if I&#8217;d wanted
to.&#8221; He smiled ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to go over what&#8217;s happened
between us,&#8221; declared Doubler coldly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re lettin&#8217; that go by. If you&#8217;ll stick
to the palaver that you spoke about mebbe
we&#8217;ll be able to git along for a minute or
two. Meanwhile, you&#8217;ll excuse me if I keep
this here gun in shape for you if you try any
monkey business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan masked his dislike of Doubler
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
under a deprecatory smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221;
he agreed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll let what&#8217;s happened pass
without talking about it. What&#8217;s between
us now is something different. I&#8217;ve never
pretended to be your friend, and I&#8217;m not
pretending to be your friend now. But
I&#8217;ve always been square with you, and I&#8217;m
square now. Can you say that about him?&#8221;
He jerked his thumb in the direction of the
river trail, on which Dakota had vanished
some time before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Him?&#8221; inquired Doubler. &#8220;You mean
Dakota?&#8221; He caught Duncan&#8217;s nod and
smiled slowly. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re some off
your range,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no comparin&#8217;
Dakota to you&mdash;he&#8217;s always been my
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s got a friend one day and he&#8217;s
an enemy the next,&#8221; said Duncan mysteriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that Dakota ain&#8217;t so much of
a friend as you think he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doubler&#8217;s lips grew straight and hard.
&#8220;I reckon that ends the palaver,&#8221; he said
coldly, while he fingered the rifle in his hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
significantly. &#8220;If that&#8217;s what you come
for you can be hittin&#8217; the breeze right back
to the Double R. I&#8217;m givin&#8217; you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re traveling too fast,&#8221; remonstrated
Duncan, a hoarseness coming into
his voice. &#8220;You&#8217;ll talk different when you
hear what I&#8217;ve got to say. I reckon you
know that Langford ain&#8217;t any friendly to
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see&mdash;&#8221; began Doubler.</p>
<p>He was interrupted by Duncan&#8217;s harsh
laugh. &#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t see,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come over here to make you open your
eyes. Langford ain&#8217;t no friend of yours,
and I reckon that you wouldn&#8217;t consider
any man your friend which sets in his cabin
a couple of hours talking to Langford, about
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; that Langford&#8217;s been to see
Dakota?&#8221; Doubler&#8217;s voice was suddenly
harsh and his eyes glinted with suspicion.
Certain that he had scored, Duncan turned
and smiled into the distance. When he
again faced Doubler his face wore an expression
of sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a man&#8217;s been a friend to you and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
you find that he&#8217;s going to double cross you,
it&#8217;s apt to make you feel pretty mean,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m allowing that. But there&#8217;s a
lot of us get double crossed. I got it and
I&#8217;m seeing that they don&#8217;t ring in any cold
deck on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know Dakota&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to
do that?&#8221; demanded Doubler.</p>
<p>Duncan laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve kept my eyes
open. Also, I&#8217;ve been listening right hard.
I wasn&#8217;t so far away when Langford went
to Dakota&#8217;s shack, and I heard considerable
of what they said about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doubler&#8217;s interest was now intense; he
spoke eagerly: &#8220;What did they say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you ought to be able to guess
what they said,&#8221; said Duncan with a crafty
smile. &#8220;I reckon you know that Langford
wants your land mighty bad, don&#8217;t you?
And you won&#8217;t sell. Didn&#8217;t he tell you in
front of me that he was going to make
trouble for you? He wants me to make it,
though; he wants me to set the boys on you.
But I won&#8217;t do it. Then he shuts up like a
clam and don&#8217;t say anything more to me
about it. He saw Dakota send Blanca over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
the divide and he&#8217;s some impressed by his
shooting. He figures that if Dakota puts
one man out of business he&#8217;ll put another
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; that Langford&#8217;s hired Dakota
to look for me?&#8221; Doubler&#8217;s eyes were
gleaming brightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re some keen, after all,&#8221; taunted
Duncan.</p>
<p>Doubler&#8217;s jaws snapped. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
liar!&#8221; he said; &#8220;Dakota wouldn&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m a liar,&#8221; said Duncan, his
face paling but his voice low and quiet. He
was not surprised that Doubler should exhibit
emotion over the charge that his friend
was planning to murder him, yet he knew
that the suspicion once established in Doubler&#8217;s
mind would soon grow to the stature of
a conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m a liar,&#8221; repeated Duncan.
&#8220;But if you&#8217;ll use your brain a little you&#8217;ll
see that things look bad for you. Dakota&#8217;s
been here. Did he tell you about Langford
coming to see him? I reckon not,&#8221; he added
as he caught Doubler&#8217;s blank stare; &#8220;he&#8217;d
likely not tell you about it. But I reckon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
that if he was your friend he&#8217;d tell you. I
reckon you told him about Langford wanting
your land&mdash;about him telling you he&#8217;d
make things hot for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doubler nodded silently, and Duncan
continued. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, with a short
laugh, &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you, and it&#8217;s up to you.
They were talking about you, and if Dakota&#8217;s
your friend, as you&#8217;re claiming him
to be, he&#8217;d have told you what they was talking
about&mdash;if it wasn&#8217;t what I say it was&mdash;him
knowing how Langford feels toward
you. And they didn&#8217;t only talk. Langford
wrote something on a paper and gave it to
Dakota. I don&#8217;t know what he wrote, but
it seemed to tickle Dakota a heap. Leastways,
he done a heap of laffing over it.
Likely Langford&#8217;s promised him a heap of
dust to do the job. Mebbe he&#8217;s your friend,
but if I was you I wouldn&#8217;t give him no
chance to say I drawed first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doubler placed his rifle down and passed
a hand slowly and hesitatingly over his forehead.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to think that of Dakota,&#8221;
he said, faith and suspicion battling
for supremacy. &#8220;Dakota just left here; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
acted a heap friendly&mdash;as usual&mdash;mebbe
more so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that when a man goes gunning
for another man he don&#8217;t advertise a whole
lot,&#8221; observed Duncan insinuatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Doubler, staring blankly
into the distance where he had last seen his
supposed friend, &#8220;a man don&#8217;t generally do
a heap of advertisin&#8217; when he&#8217;s out lookin&#8217; for
a man.&#8221; He sat for a time staring straight
ahead, and then he suddenly looked up, his
eyes filled with a savage fierceness. &#8220;How
do I know you ain&#8217;t lyin&#8217; to me?&#8221; he demanded,
glaring at Duncan, his hands
clenched in an effort to control himself.</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s eyes did not waver. &#8220;I reckon
you <i>don&#8217;t</i> know whether I&#8217;m lying,&#8221; he returned,
showing his teeth in a slight smile.
&#8220;But I reckon you&#8217;re twenty-one and ought
to have your eye-teeth cut. Anyway, you
ought to know that a man like Langford,
who&#8217;s wanting your land, don&#8217;t go to talk
with a man like Dakota, who&#8217;s some on the
shoot, for nothing. How do you know that
Langford and Dakota ain&#8217;t friends? How
do you know but that they&#8217;ve been friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
back East? Do you know where Dakota
came from? Mebbe he&#8217;s from the East, too.
I&#8217;m telling you one thing,&#8221; added Duncan,
and now his voice was filled with passion,
&#8220;Dakota and Sheila Langford are pretty
thick. She makes believe that she don&#8217;t like
him, but he saved her from a quicksand, and
she&#8217;s been running with him considerable.
Takes his part, too; does it, but she makes
you believe that she don&#8217;t like him. I reckon
she&#8217;s pretty foxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doubler&#8217;s memory went back to a conversation
he had had with Sheila in which
Dakota had been the subject under discussion.
He remembered that she had shown
a decided coldness, suggesting by her manner
that she and Dakota were not on the
best of terms. Could it be that she had
merely pretended this coldness? Could it
be that she was concerned in the plot against
him, that she and her father and Dakota
were combined against him for the common
purpose of taking his life?</p>
<p>He was convinced that any such suspicion
against Sheila must be unjust, for he had
studied her face many times and was certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
that there was not a line of deceit in it.
And yet, was it not odd that, when he had
told her of the trouble between him and her
father, she had not immediately taken her
parent&#8217;s side? To be sure, she had told him
that Langford was merely her stepfather,
but could not that statement also have been
a misleading one? And even if Langford
were only her stepfather, would she not
have felt it her duty to align herself with
him?</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you know a heap about Dakota,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; came Duncan&#8217;s voice,
breaking into Doubler&#8217;s reflections. &#8220;You
know, for instance, that Dakota came here
from Dakota&mdash;or anyway, he says he came
here from there. We&#8217;ll say you know that.
But what do you know about Langford?
Didn&#8217;t he tell you that he was going to &#8216;get&#8217;
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan turned his back to Doubler and
walked to his pony. He drew out his six-shooter,
stuck it into its holster, and placed
one foot in a stirrup, preparatory to mounting.
Then he turned and spoke gravely to
Doubler.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done all I could,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
know how you stand and the rest of it is up
to you. You can go on, letting Dakota and
Sheila pretend to be friendly to you, and
some day you&#8217;ll get wise awful sudden&mdash;when
it&#8217;s too late. Or, you can wise up now
and fix Dakota before he gets a chance at
you. I reckon that&#8217;s all. You can&#8217;t say
that I didn&#8217;t put you wise to the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung into the saddle and urged the
pony toward the crossing. Looking back
from a crest of a rise on the other side of the
river, he saw Doubler still standing in the
doorway, his head bowed in his hands. Duncan
smiled, his lips in cold, crafty curves,
for he had planted the seed of suspicion and
was satisfied that it would presently flourish
and grow until it would finally accomplish
the destruction of his rival, Dakota.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A MEETING ON THE RIVER TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>About ten o&#8217;clock in the morning of
a perfect day Sheila left the Double
R ranchhouse for a ride to the Two
Forks to visit Doubler. This new world
into which she had come so hopefully had
lately grown very lonesome. It had promised
much and it had given very little. The
country itself was not to blame for the state
of her mind, though, she told herself as she
rode over the brown, sun-scorched grass of
the river trail, it was the people. They&mdash;even
her father&mdash;seemed to hold aloof from
her.</p>
<p>It seemed that she would never be able to
fit in anywhere. She was convinced that the
people with whom she was forced to associate
were entirely out of accord with the
principles of life which had been her guide&mdash;they
appeared selfish, cold, and distant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Duncan&#8217;s sister, the only woman beside herself
in the vicinity, had discouraged all her
little advances toward a better acquaintance,
betraying in many ways a disinclination
toward those exchanges of confidence
which are the delight of every normal
woman. Sheila had become aware very soon
that there could be no hope of gaining her
friendship or confidence and so of late she
had ceased her efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, she could not attempt to cultivate
an acquaintance with any of the cowboys&mdash;she
already knew <i>one</i> too well, and
the knowledge of her relationship to him
had the effect of dulling her desire for seeking
the company of the others.</p>
<p>For Duncan she had developed a decided
dislike which amounted almost to hatred.
She had been able to see quite early in their
acquaintance the defects of his character,
and though she had played on his jealousy
in a spirit of fun, she had been careful to
make him see that anything more than mere
acquaintance was impossible. At least that
was what she had tried to do, and she
doubted much whether she had succeeded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>Doubler was the only one who had betrayed
any real friendship for her, and to
him, in her lonesomeness, she turned, in
spite of the warning he had given her. She
had visited him once since the day following
her father&#8217;s visit, and he had received her
with his usual cordiality, but she had been
able to detect a certain constraint in his manner
which had caused her to determine to
stay away from the Two Forks. But this
morning she felt that she must go somewhere,
and she selected Doubler&#8217;s cabin.</p>
<p>Since that day when on the edge of the
butte overlooking the river Duncan had
voiced his suspicions that her father had
planned to remove Doubler, Sheila had felt
more than ever the always widening gulf
that separated her from her parent. From
the day on which he had become impatient
with her when she had questioned him concerning
his intentions with regard to Doubler
he had treated her in much the manner
that he always treated her, though it had
seemed to her that there was something
lacking; there was a certain strained civility
in his manner, a veneer which smoothed over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the breach of trust which his attitude that
day had created.</p>
<p>Many times, watching him, Sheila had
wondered why she had never been able to
peer through the mask of his imperturbability
at the real, unlovely character it concealed.
She believed it was because she had
always trusted him and had not taken the
trouble to try to uncover his real character.
She had tried for a long time to fight down
the inevitable, growing estrangement, telling
herself that she had been, and was, mistaken
in her estimate of his character since
the day he had told her not to meddle with
his affairs, and she had nearly succeeded in
winning the fight when Duncan had again
destroyed her faith with the story of her
father&#8217;s visit to Dakota.</p>
<p>Duncan had added two and two, he had
told her when furnishing her with the
threads out of which he had constructed the
fabric of his suspicions, and she was compelled
to acknowledge that they seemed sufficiently
strong. Contemplation of the situation,
however, had convinced her that Dakota
was partly to blame, and her anger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
against him&mdash;greatly softened since the rescue
at the quicksand&mdash;flared out again.</p>
<p>Two weeks had passed since Duncan had
told her of his suspicions, and they had been
two weeks of constant worry and dread to
her.</p>
<p>Unable to stand the suspense longer she
had finally decided to seek out Dakota to
attempt to confirm Duncan&#8217;s story of her
father&#8217;s visit and to plead with Dakota to
withhold his hand. But first she would see
Doubler.</p>
<p>The task of talking to Dakota about anything
was not to her liking, but she compromised
with her conscience by telling herself
that she owed it to herself to prevent
the murder of Doubler&mdash;that if the nester
should be killed with her in possession of
the plan for his taking off, and able to lift a
hand in protest or warning, she would be as
guilty as her father or Dakota.</p>
<p>As she rode she could not help contrasting
Dakota&#8217;s character to those of her father
and Duncan. She eliminated Duncan immediately,
as being not strong enough to
compare either favorably or unfavorably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
with either of the other two. And, much
against her will, she was compelled to admit
that with all his shortcomings Dakota
made a better figure than her father. But
there was little consolation for her in this
comparison, for she bitterly assured herself
that there was nothing attractive in either.
Both had wronged her&mdash;Dakota deliberately
and maliciously; her father had placed the
bar of a cold civility between her and himself,
and she could no longer go to him with
her confidences. She had lost his friendship,
and he had lost her respect.</p>
<p>Of late she had speculated much over Dakota.
That day at the quicksand crossing
he had seemed to be a different man from
the one who had stood with revolver in hand
before the closed door of his cabin, giving
her a choice of two evils. For one thing,
she was no longer afraid of him; in his treatment
of her at the crossing he had not appeared
as nearly so forbidding as formerly,
had been almost attractive to her, in those
moments when she could forget the injury
he had done her. Those moments had been
few, to be sure, but during them she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
caught flashes of the real Dakota, and
though she fought against admiring him,
she knew that deep in her heart lingered an
emotion which must be taken into account.
He had really done her no serious injury,
nothing which would not be undone through
the simple process of the law, and in his
manner on the day of the rescue there had
been much respect, and in spite of the mocking
levity with which he had met her reproaches
she felt that he felt some slight remorse
over his action.</p>
<p>For a time she forgot to think about Dakota,
becoming lost in contemplation of the
beauty of the country. Sweeping away
from the crest of the ridge on which she was
riding, it lay before her, basking in the warm
sunlight of the morning, wild and picturesque,
motionless, silent&mdash;as quiet and
peaceful as might have been that morning
on which, his work finished, the Creator had
surveyed the new world with a satisfied eye.</p>
<p>She had reached a point about a mile
from Doubler&#8217;s cabin, still drinking in the
beauty that met her eyes on every hand,
when an odd sound broke the perfect quiet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>Suddenly alert, she halted her pony and
listened.</p>
<p>The sound had been strangely like a pistol
shot, though louder, she decided, as she
listened to its echo reverberating in the adjacent
hills. It became fainter, and finally
died away, and she sat for a long time motionless
in the saddle, listening, but no other
sound disturbed the solemn quiet that surrounded
her.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that the sound had come
from the direction of Doubler&#8217;s cabin, but
she was not quite certain, knowing how difficult
it was to determine the direction of
sound in so vast a stretch of country.</p>
<p>She ceased to speculate, and once more
gave her attention to the country, urging
her pony forward, riding down the slope
of the ridge to the level of the river trail.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, still holding the
river trail, she saw a horseman approaching,
and long before he came near enough
for her to distinguish his features she knew
the rider for Dakota. He was sitting carelessly
in the saddle, one leg thrown over
the pommel, smoking a cigarette, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
he saw her he threw the latter away, doffed
his broad hat, and smiled gravely at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you shooting?&#8221; she questioned,
aware that this was an odd greeting, but
eager to have the mystery of that lone shot
cleared up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I ain&#8217;t been shooting&mdash;lately,&#8221;
he returned. &#8220;It must have been Doubler.
I heard it myself. I&#8217;ve just left Doubler,
and he was cleaning his rifle. He must
have been trying it. I do that myself, often,
after I&#8217;ve cleaned mine, just to make
sure it&#8217;s right.&#8221; He narrowed his eyes
whimsically at her. &#8220;So you&#8217;re riding the
fiver trail again?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought
you&#8217;d be doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she questioned, defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for one thing, there&#8217;s a certain
fascination about a place where one has
been close to cashing in&mdash;I expect that when
we&#8217;ve been in such a place we like to come
back and look at it just to see how near we
came to going over the divide. And there&#8217;s
another reason why I expected to see you
on the river trail again. You forgot to
thank me for pulling you out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>He deserved thanks for that, she knew.
But there were in his voice and eyes the
same subtle mockery which had marked his
manner that other time, and as before she
experienced a feeling of deep resentment.
Why could he not have shown some evidence
of remorse for his crime against her?
She believed that had he done so now she
might have found it in her heart to go a
little distance toward forgiving him. But
there was only mockery in his voice and
words and her resentment against him grew.
Mingling with it, moreover, was the bitterness
which had settled over her within the
last few days. It found expression in her
voice when she answered him:</p>
<p>&#8220;This country is full of&mdash;of savages!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians, you mean, I reckon? Well,
no, there are none around here&mdash;excepting
over near Fort Union, on the reservation.&#8221;
He drawled hatefully and regarded her
with a mild smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean white savages!&#8221; she declared
spitefully.</p>
<p>His smile grew broader, and then slowly
faded and he sat quiet, studying her face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
The silence grew painful; she moved uneasily
under his direct gaze and a dash of
color swept into her cheeks. Then he spoke
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You been seeing white savages?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; venomously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not around here?&#8221; The hateful mockery
of that drawl!</p>
<p>&#8220;I am talking to one,&#8221; she said, her eyes
blazing with impotent anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you was meaning me,&#8221; he
said, without resentment. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve
got it coming to me. But at the same time
that isn&#8217;t exactly the way to talk to
your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He hesitated and smiled oddly,
apparently aware that he had made a mistake
in referring to his crime against her.
He hastened to repair it. &#8220;Your rescuer,&#8221;
he corrected.</p>
<p>However, she saw through the artifice,
and the bitterness in her voice grew more
pronounced. &#8220;It is needless for you to remind
me of our relationship,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I
am not likely to forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you told your father yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>In his voice was the quiet scorn and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
peculiar, repressed venom which she had detected
when he had referred to her father
during that other occasion at the crossing.
It mystified her, and yet within the past few
days she had felt this scorn herself and knew
that it was not remarkable. Undoubtedly
he, having had much experience with men,
had been able to see through Langford&#8217;s
mask and knew him for what he was. For
the first time in her life she experienced a
sensation of embarrassed guilt over hearing
her name linked with Langford&#8217;s, and she
looked defiantly at Dakota.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not told him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t tell him. I told you that before&mdash;I
do not care to undergo the humiliation of
hearing my name mentioned in the same
breath with yours. And if you do not already
know it, I want to tell you that David
Langford is not my father; my real father
died a long time ago, and Langford is only
my stepfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden moisture was in her eyes and
she did not see Dakota start, did not observe
the queer pallor that spread over his
face, failed to detect the odd light in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
eyes. However, she heard his voice&mdash;sharp
in tone and filled with genuine astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your stepfather?&#8221; He had spurred
his pony beside hers and looking up she saw
that his face had suddenly grown stern and
grim. &#8220;Do you mean that?&#8221; he demanded
half angrily. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me
that before? Why didn&#8217;t you tell me when&mdash;the
night I married you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it have made any difference to
you?&#8221; she said bitterly. &#8220;Does it make
any difference now? You have treated me
like a savage; you are treating me like one
now. I&mdash;I haven&#8217;t any friends at all,&#8221; she
continued, her voice breaking slightly, as
she suddenly realized her entire helplessness
before the combined evilness of Duncan, her
father, and the man who sat on his pony
beside her. A sob shook her, and her hands
went to her face, covering her eyes.</p>
<p>She sat there for a time, shuddering, and
watching her closely, Dakota&#8217;s face grew
slowly pale, and grim, hard lines came into
his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what Duncan&#8217;s friendship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
amounts to,&#8221; he said harshly. &#8220;But isn&#8217;t
your stepfather your friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend?&#8221; She echoed his words
with a hopeless intonation that closed Dakota&#8217;s
teeth like a vise. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
has come over him,&#8221; she continued, looking
up at Dakota, her eyes filled with wonder for
the sympathy which she saw in his face and
voice; &#8220;he has changed since he came out
here; he is so selfish and heartless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he been doing? Hurting you?&#8221;
She did not detect the anger in his voice, for
he had kept it so low that she scarcely heard
the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurting me? No; he has not done anything
to me. Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; she said
scornfully, certain that he was mocking her
again&mdash;for how could his interest be genuine
when he was a party to the plot to murder
Doubler? Yet perhaps not&mdash;maybe
Duncan <i>had</i> been lying. Determined to
get to the bottom of the affair as quickly
as possible, Sheila continued rapidly, her
scorn giving way to eagerness. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
know?&#8221; And this time her voice was almost
a plea. &#8220;What did father visit you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
for? Wasn&#8217;t it about Doubler? Didn&#8217;t he
hire you to&mdash;to kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw his lips tighten strangely, his
face grow pale, his eyes flash with some mysterious
emotion, and she knew in an instant
that he was guilty&mdash;guilty as her father!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, and the scorn came into
her voice again. &#8220;Then it is true! You
and my father have conspired to murder an
inoffensive old man! You&mdash;you cowards!&#8221;</p>
<p>He winced, as though he had received an
unexpected blow in the face, but almost immediately
he smiled&mdash;a hard, cold, sneering
smile which chilled her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who has been telling you this?&#8221; The
question came slowly, without the slightest
trace of excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan?&#8221; There was much contempt
in his voice. &#8220;Not your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head negatively, wondering
at his cold composure. No wonder her
father had selected him!</p>
<p>He laughed mirthlessly. &#8220;So that&#8217;s the
reason Doubler was so friendly to his rifle
this morning?&#8221; he said, as though her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
words had explained a mystery which had
been puzzling him. &#8220;Doubler and me have
been friends for a long time. But this
morning while I was talking to him he kept
his rifle beside him all the time. He must
have heard from someone that I was gunning
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you haven&#8217;t been hired to kill
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at her eagerness, but spoke
gravely and with an earnestness which she
could not help but feel. &#8220;Miss Sheila,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t money enough in ten
counties like this to make me kill Doubler.&#8221;
His lips curled with a quiet sarcasm. &#8220;You
are like a lot of other people in this country,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;Because I put Blanca
away they think I am a professional gunman.
But I want <i>you</i>&#8221;&mdash;he placed a significant
emphasis on the word&mdash;&#8220;to understand
that there wasn&#8217;t any other way to
deal with Blanca. By coming back here
after selling me that stolen Star stock and
refusing to admit the deed in the presence
of other people&mdash;even denying it and accusing
me&mdash;he forced me to take the step I did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
with him. Even then, I gave him his
chance. That he didn&#8217;t take it isn&#8217;t my
fault.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I look pretty black to you,
because I treated you like I did. But it
was partly your fault, too. Maybe that&#8217;s
mysterious to you, but it will have to stay a
mystery. I had an idea in my head that
night&mdash;and something else. I&#8217;ve found
something out since that makes me feel a lot
sorry. If I had known what I know now,
that wouldn&#8217;t have happened to you&mdash;I&#8217;ve
got my eyes open now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their ponies were very close together,
and leaning over suddenly he placed both
hands on her shoulders and gazed into her
eyes, his own flashing with a strange light.
She did not try to escape his hands, for she
felt that his sincerity warranted the action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve treated you mean, Sheila,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;about as mean as a man could treat a
woman. I am sorry. I want you to believe
that. And maybe some day&mdash;when
this business is over&mdash;you&#8217;ll understand and
forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This business?&#8221; Sheila drew back and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
looked at him wonderingly. &#8220;What do
you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no mirth in his laugh as he
dropped his hands to his sides. Her question
had brought about a return of that
mocking reserve which she could not penetrate.
Apparently he would let her no farther
into the mystery whose existence his
words had betrayed. He had allowed her
to get a glimpse of his inner self; had shown
her that he was not the despicable creature
she had thought him; had apparently been
about to take her into his confidence. And
she had felt a growing sympathy for him
and had been prepared to meet him half
way in an effort to settle their differences,
but she saw that the opportunity was gone&mdash;was
hidden under the cloak of mystery
which had been about him from the beginning
of their acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Doubler business,&#8221; he answered,
and she nibbled impatiently at her lips,
knowing that he had meant something else.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s evasion,&#8221; she said, looking
straight at him, hoping that he would relent
and speak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; In his unwavering eyes she saw
a glint of grim humor. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the
answer. I am not going to kill Doubler&mdash;if
it will do you any good to know. I don&#8217;t
kill my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said eagerly, catching at the
hope which he held out to her, &#8220;father didn&#8217;t
hire you to kill him? You didn&#8217;t talk to
father about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>His lips curled. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ask
your father about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope died within her. Dakota&#8217;s
words and manner implied that her father
had tried to employ him to make way with
the nester, but that he had refused. She
had not been wrong&mdash;Duncan had not been
wrong in his suspicion that her father was
planning the death of the nester. Duncan&#8217;s
only mistake was in including Dakota in
the scheme.</p>
<p>She had hoped against hope that she
might discover that Duncan had been wrong
altogether; that she had done her father an
injury in believing him capable of deliberately
planning a murder. She looked again
at Dakota. There was no mistaking his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
earnestness, she thought, for there was no
evidence of deceit or knavery in his face,
nor in the eyes that were steadily watching
her.</p>
<p>She put her hands to her face and shivered,
now thoroughly convinced of her
father&#8217;s guilt; feeling a sudden repugnance
for him, for everybody and everything in
the country, excepting Doubler.</p>
<p>She had done all she could, however, to
prevent them killing Doubler&mdash;all she could
do except to warn Doubler of his danger,
and she would go to him immediately.
Without looking again at Dakota she
turned, dry eyed and pale, urging her pony
up the trail toward the nester&#8217;s cabin, leaving
Dakota sitting silent in his saddle,
watching her.</p>
<p>She lingered on the trail, riding slowly,
halting when she came to a spot which offered
a particularly good view of the country
surrounding her, for in spite of her lonesomeness
she could not help appreciating
the beauty of the land, with its towering
mountains, its blue sky, its vast, yawning
distances, and the peacefulness which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
seemed to be everywhere except in her heart.</p>
<p>She presently reached the Two Forks and
urged her pony through the shallow water of
its crossing, riding up the slight, intervening
slope and upon a stretch of plain beside
a timber grove. A little later she came to
the corral gates, where she dismounted and
hitched her pony to a rail, smiling to herself
as she thought of how surprised Doubler
would be to see her.</p>
<p>Then she left the corral gate and stole
softly around a corner of the cabin, determined
to steal upon Doubler unawares.
Once at the corner, she halted and peered
around. She saw Doubler lying in the
open doorway, his body twisted into a peculiarly
odd position, face down, his arms outstretched,
his legs doubled under him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE SHOT IN THE BACK</h3>
</div>

<p>For an instant after discovering Doubler
lying in the doorway, Sheila stood
motionless at the corner of the cabin,
looking down wonderingly at him. She
thought at first that he was merely resting,
but his body was doubled up so oddly that
a grave doubt rose in her mind. A vague
fear clutched at her heart, and she stood
rigid, her eyes wide as she looked for some
sign that would confirm her fears. And
then she saw a moist red patch on his shirt
on the right side just below the shoulder
blade, and it seemed that a band of steel had
been suddenly pressed down over her forehead.
Something had happened to Doubler!</p>
<p>The world reeled, objects around her
danced fantastically, the trees in the grove
near her seemed to dip toward her in derision,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
her knees sagged and she held tightly
to the corner of the cabin for support in her
weakness.</p>
<p>She saw it all in a flash. Dakota had
been to visit Doubler and had shot him.
She had heard the shot. Duncan had been
right, and Dakota&mdash;how she despised him
now!&mdash;was probably even now picturing in
his imagination the scene of her discovering
the nester lying on his own threshold, murdered.
An anger against him, which arose
at the thought, did much to help her regain
control of herself.</p>
<p>She must be brave now, for there might
still be life in Doubler&#8217;s body, and she went
slowly toward him, cringing and shrinking,
along the wall of the cabin.</p>
<p>She touched him first, lightly with the
tips of her fingers, calling softly to him in
a quavering voice. Becoming more bold,
she took hold of him by the left shoulder
and shook him slightly, and her heart seemed
to leap within her when a faint moan escaped
his lips. Her fear fled instantly as she realized
that he was alive, that she had not to
deal with a dead man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>Stifling a quivering sob she took hold of
him again, tugging and pulling at him, trying
to turn him over so that she might see
his face. She observed that the red patch
on his shoulder grew larger with the effort,
and her face grew paler with apprehension,
but convinced that she must persist she shut
her eyes and tugged desperately at him, finally
succeeding in pulling him over on his
back.</p>
<p>He moaned again, though his face was
ashen and lifeless, and with hope filling her
heart she redoubled her efforts and finally
succeeded in dragging him inside the cabin,
out of the sun, where he lay inert, with wide-stretched
arms, a gruesome figure to the
girl.</p>
<p>Panting and exhausted, some stray wisps
of hair sweeping her temples, the rest of it
threatening to come tumbling down around
her shoulders, she leaned against one of the
door jambs, thinking rapidly. She ought
to have help, of course, and her thoughts
went to Dakota, riding unconcernedly away
on the river trail. She could not go to him
for assistance, such a course was not to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
considered, she would rather let Doubler
die than to go to his murderer; she could
never have endured the irony of such an action.
Besides, she was certain that even
were she to go to him, he would find some
excuse to refuse her, for having shot the
nester, he certainly would do nothing toward
bringing the help which might possibly
restore him to life.</p>
<p>She put aside the thought with a shudder
of horror, yet conscious that something must
be done for Doubler at once if he was to live.
Perhaps it was already too late to go for assistance;
there seemed to be but very little
life in his body, and trembling with anxiety
she decided that she must render him whatever
aid she could. There was not much
that she could do, to be sure, but if she could
do something she might keep him alive until
other help would come.</p>
<p>She stood beside the door jamb and
watched him for some time, for she dreaded
the idea of touching him again, but after a
while her courage returned, and she again
went to him, kneeling down beside him, laying
her head on his breast and listening.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
His heart was beating, faintly, but still it
was beating, and she rose from him, determined.</p>
<p>She found a sheath knife in one of his
pockets, and with this she cut the shirt away
from the wound, discovering, when she drew
the pieces of cloth away, that there was a
large, round hole in his breast. She came
near to swooning when she thought of the
red patch on his back, for that seemed to
prove that the bullet had gone clear through
him. It had missed a vital spot, though,
she thought, for it seemed to be rather high
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>She got some water from a pail that stood
just inside the door, and with this and some
white cloth which she tore from one of her
skirts, she bathed and bandaged the wound
and laid a wet cloth on his forehead. She
tried to force some of the water down his
throat, but he could not swallow, lying there
with closed eyes and drawing his breath in
short, painful gasps.</p>
<p>After she had worked with him for a
quarter of an hour or more she stood up,
convinced that she had done all she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
for him and that the next move would be
to get a doctor.</p>
<p>She had heard Duncan say that it was
fifty miles to Dry Bottom, and she knew
that it was at least forty to Lazette. She
had never heard anyone mention that there
was a doctor nearer, and so of course she
would have to go to Lazette&mdash;ten miles
would make a great difference.</p>
<p>She might ride to the Double R ranchhouse,
and she thought of going there, but
it was at least ten miles off the Lazette trail,
and even though at the Double R she might
get a cowboy to make the ride to Lazette,
she would be losing much valuable time.
She drew a deep breath over the contemplation
of the long ride&mdash;at best it would take
her four hours&mdash;but she did not hesitate
long and with a last glance at Doubler she
was out of the door and walking to the corral,
where she unhitched her pony, mounted,
and sent the animal over the level toward
the crossing at a sharp gallop.</p>
<p>Once over the crossing and on the river
trail where the riding was better, she held
the pony to an even, steady pace. One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
mile, two miles, five or six she rode with her
hair flying in the breeze, her cheeks pale,
except for a bright red spot in the center of
each&mdash;which betrayed the excitement under
which she was laboring. There was a resolute
gleam in her eyes, though, and she rode
lightly, helping her pony as much as possible.
However, the animal was fresh and
did not seem to mind the pace, cavorting
and lunging up the rises and pulling hard
on the reins on the levels, showing a desire
to run. She held it in, though, realizing
that during the forty mile ride the animal
would have plenty of opportunity to prove
its mettle.</p>
<p>She reached and passed the quicksand
crossing from which she had been pulled by
Dakota, the pony running with the sure
regularity of a machine, and was on a level
which led into some hills directly ahead,
when the pony stumbled.</p>
<p>She tried to jerk it erect with the reins,
but in spite of the effort she felt it sink under
her, and with a sensation of dismay
clutching at her heart she slid out of the
saddle.</p>
<p>A swift examination showed her that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
pony&#8217;s right fore-leg was deep in the sand
of the trail, and she surmised instantly that
it had stepped into a prairie dog hole. When
she went to it and raised its head it looked
appealingly at her, and she stifled a groan
of sympathy and began looking about for
some means to extricate it.</p>
<p>She found this no easy task, for the pony&#8217;s
leg was deep in the sand, and when she finally
dug a space around it with a branch of
tree which she procured from a nearby
grove, the animal struggled out, only to
limp badly. The leg, Sheila decided, after
a quick examination, was not broken, but
badly sprained, and she knew enough about
horses to be certain that the injured
pony would never be able to carry her
to Lazette.</p>
<p>She would be forced to go to the Double
R now, there was nothing else that she could
do. Standing beside the pony, debating
whether she had not better walk than try
to ride him, even to the Double R, she heard
a clatter of hoofs and turned to see Dakota
riding the trail toward her. He was traveling
in the direction she had been traveling
when the accident had happened, and apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
had left the trail somewhere back
in the distance, or she would have seen
him. Perhaps, she speculated, with a flash
of dull anger, he had followed her near
to Doubler&#8217;s cabin, perhaps had been near
when she had dragged the wounded nester
into it.</p>
<p>His first word showed her that there was
ground for this suspicion. He drew up beside
her and looked at her with a queer
smile, and she, aware of his guilt, wondered
at his composure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t stay long at Doubler&#8217;s
shack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was on a ridge, back
on the trail a ways, and I saw you hitting
the breeze away from there some rapid. I
was thinking to intercept you, but you went
tearing by so fast that I didn&#8217;t get a chance.
You&#8217;re in an awful hurry. What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to know that,&#8221; she said, bitterly
angry because of his pretended serenity.
&#8220;You&mdash;you murderer!&#8221;</p>
<p>His face paled instantly, but his voice was
clear and sharp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Murderer?&#8221; he said sternly. &#8220;Who
has been murdered?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know, of course,&#8221; she said
scornfully, her face flaming, her eyes alight
with loathing and contempt. &#8220;You shot
him and then let me ride on alone to&mdash;to
find him, shot&mdash;shot in the back! Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>She shuddered at the recollection, held
her hands over her eyes for an instant to
keep from looking at the expression of
amazement in his eyes, and while she stood
thus she heard a movement, and withdrew
her hands from her eyes to see him standing
beside her, so close that his body touched
hers, his eyes ablaze with curiosity and interest
and repressed anxiety. She cringed
and cried with pain as he seized her arm and
twisted her forcibly around so that she faced
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop this fooling and tell me what has
happened!&#8221; he said, with short, incisive accents.
&#8220;Who did you find shot? Who has
been murdered?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, it was admirable acting, she told herself
as she tore herself away from him and
stood back a little, her eyes flashing with
scorn and horror. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know, of
course,&#8221; she flared. &#8220;You shot him&mdash;shot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
him in the back and sent me on to find him.
You gloried in the thought of me finding
him dead. But he isn&#8217;t dead, thank God,
and will live, if I can get a doctor, to accuse
you!&#8221; She pointed a finger at him, but he
ignored it and took a step toward her, his
eyes cold and boring into hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben Doubler. Oh!&#8221; she cried, in an
excess of rage and horror, &#8220;to think that I
should have to tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>But if he heard her last words he paid no
attention to them, for he was suddenly at his
pony&#8217;s side, buckling the cinches tighter.
She watched him, fascinated at the repressed
energy of his movements, and became so interested
that she started when he suddenly
looked up at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t dead, then,&#8221; he said rapidly,
sharply, the words coming with short, metallic
snaps. &#8220;You were going to Lazette
for a doctor. I&#8217;m glad I happened along&mdash;glad
I saw you. I&#8217;ll be able to make better
time than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; she demanded,
scarcely having heard his words, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
aware that he was preparing to leave. She
took a step forward and seized his pony&#8217;s
bridle rein, her eyes blazing with wrath over
the thought that he should attempt to deceive
her with so bald a ruse.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the doctor,&#8221; he said shortly. &#8220;This
is no time for melodramatics, ma&#8217;am, if
Doubler is badly hurt. Will you please let
go of that bridle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; she demanded, her
cheeks aflame, her hair, loosened from the
long ride, straggling over her temples and
giving her a singularly disheveled appearance,
&#8220;that I am going to let you go for the
doctor? You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a case where your feelings
should be considered, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
Ben Doubler has been hurt like you think
he has I&#8217;m going to get the doctor mighty
sudden, whether you think I ought to or
not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t!&#8221; she declared, stamping a;
foot furiously. &#8220;You shot him and now
you want to disarm suspicion by going after
the doctor for him. But you won&#8217;t! I
won&#8217;t let you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; he said rapidly. &#8220;The
doctor isn&#8217;t at Lazette; he is over on Carrizo
Creek, taking care of Dave Moreland&#8217;s
wife, who is down bad. I saw Dave yesterday,
and he was telling me about her; that
the doctor is to stay there until she is out
of danger. You don&#8217;t know where Moreland&#8217;s
place is. Be sensible, now,&#8221; he said
gruffly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you later about you
suspecting me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t go,&#8221; she protested; &#8220;I am
going myself. I will find Moreland&#8217;s place.
I can&#8217;t let you go&mdash;it would be horrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer he swung quickly down from
the saddle, seized her by the waist, disengaged
her hands from the bridle rein, and
picking her up bodily carried her, struggling
and fighting and striking blindly at his face,
to the side of the trail. When he set her
down he pinned her arms to her sides. He
did not speak, and she was entirely helpless
in his grasp, but when he released his grasp
of her arms and tried to leave her she seized
the collar of his vest. With a grim laugh
he slipped out of the garment, leaving it
dangling from her hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it for me, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said with a
cold chuckle. &#8220;But get back to Doubler&#8217;s
cabin and see what you can do for him.
You&#8217;ll be able to do a lot. I&#8217;ll be back with
the doctor before sundown.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an instant he was at his pony&#8217;s side,
mounting with the animal at a run, and in a
brief space had vanished around a turn in
the trail, leaving a cloud of dust to mark
the spot where Sheila had seen him disappear.</p>
<p>For a long time Sheila stood beside the
trail, looking at the spot where he had disappeared,
holding his vest with an unconscious
grasp. Looking down she saw it and
with an exclamation of rage threw it from
her, watching it fall into the sand. But after
an instant she went over and took it up,
recovering, at the same time, a black leather
pocket memoranda which had slipped out
of it. She put the memoranda back into
one of the pockets, handling both the book
and the vest gingerly, for she felt an aversion
to touching them. She conquered this
feeling long enough to tuck the vest into the
slicker behind the saddle, and then she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
mounted and sent her pony up the trail toward
Doubler&#8217;s cabin.</p>
<p>She found Doubler where she had left
him, and he was still unconscious. The
water pail was empty and she went down
to the river and refilled it, returning to the
cabin and again bathing and bandaging
Doubler&#8217;s wound, and placing a fresh cloth
on his forehead.</p>
<p>For a time she sat watching the injured
man, revolving the incident of her discovery
of him in her mind, going over and over
again the gruesome details. She did not
dwell long on the latter, for she could not
prevent her mind reviewing Dakota&#8217;s words
and actions&mdash;his satanic cleverness in pretending
to be on the verge of taking her into
his confidence, his prediction that she would
understand when this &#8220;business&#8221; was over.
She did not need to wait, she understood
now!</p>
<p>Finding the silence in the cabin irksome,
she rose, placed Doubler&#8217;s head in a more
comfortable position, and went outside into
the bright sunshine of the afternoon. She
took a turn around the corral, abstractedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
watched the awkward antics of several yearlings
which were penned in a corner, and
then returned to the cabin door, where she
sat on the edge of the step.</p>
<p>Near the side of the cabin door, leaning
against the wall, she saw a rifle. She
started, not remembering to have seen it
there before, but presently she found courage
to take it up gingerly, turning it over
and over in her hands.</p>
<p>Some initials had been carved on the
stock and she examined them, making them
out finally as &#8220;B. D.&#8221;&mdash;Doubler&#8217;s. Examining
the weapon she found an empty shell
in the chamber, and she nearly dropped the
rifle when the thought struck her that perhaps
Doubler had been shot with it. She
set it down quickly, shuddering, and for diversion
walked to her pony, examining the
injured leg and rubbing it, the pony nickering
gratefully. Returning to the cabin she
sat for a long time on the step, but she did
not again take up the rifle. Several times
while she sat on the step she heard Doubler
moan, and once she got up and went to him,
again bathing his wound, but returning instantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
to the door step, for she could not
bear the silence of the interior.</p>
<p>Suddenly remembering Dakota&#8217;s vest and
the black leather memoranda which had
dropped from one of the pockets, she got
up again and went to the bench where she
had laid the garment, taking out the book
and regarding it with some curiosity.</p>
<p>There was nothing on the cover to suggest
what might be the nature of its contents&mdash;time
had worn away any printing
that might have been on it. She hesitated,
debating the propriety of an examination,
but her curiosity got the better of her and
with a sharp glance at Doubler she turned
her back and opened the book.</p>
<p>Almost the first object that caught her
gaze was a piece of paper, detached from
the leaves, with some writing on it. The
writing seemed unimportant, but as she
turned it, intending to replace it between the
leaves of the book, she saw her father&#8217;s
name, and she read, holding her breath with
dread, for fresh in her mind was Duncan&#8217;s
charge that her father had entered into an
agreement with Dakota for the murder of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Doubler. She read the words several times,
standing beside the bench and swaying back
and forth, a sudden weakness gripping her.</p>
<p>&#8220;One month from to-day&#8221;&mdash;ran the
words&mdash;&#8220;I promise to pay to Dakota the
sum of six thousand dollars in consideration
of his rights and interest in the Star brand,
provided that within one month from date
he persuades Ben Doubler to leave Union
County.&#8221;</p>
<p>Signed: &#8220;David Dowd Langford.&#8221;</p>
<p>There it was&mdash;conclusive, damning evidence
of her father&#8217;s guilt&mdash;and of Dakota&#8217;s!</p>
<p>How cleverly that last clause covered the
evil intent of the document! Sheila read it
again and again with dry eyes. Her horror
and grief were too great for tears. She felt
that the discovery of the paper removed the
last lingering doubt, and though she had
been partially prepared for proof, she had
not been prepared to have it thrust so
quickly and convincingly before her.</p>
<p>How long she sat on the door step she did
not know, or care, for at a stroke she had
lost all interest in everything in the country.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
Even its people interested her only to the
point of loathing&mdash;they were murderers,
even her father. Time represented to her
nothing now except a dreary space which,
if she endured, would bring the moment in
which she could leave. For within the last
few minutes she seemed to have been robbed
of all the things which had made existence
here endurable and she was determined to
end it all. When she finally got up and
looked about her she saw that the sun had
traveled quite a distance down the sky. A
sorrowful smile reached her face as she
watched it. It was going away, and before
it could complete another circle she would
go too&mdash;back to the East from where she
had come, where there were at least <i>some</i>
friends who could be depended upon to commit
no atrocious crimes.</p>
<p>No plan of action formed in her mind;
she could not think lucidly with the knowledge
that her father was convicted of complicity
in an attempted murder.</p>
<p>Would she be able to face her father
again? To bid him good-bye? She thought
not. It would be better for both if she departed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
without him being aware of her going.
He would not care, she told herself
bitterly; lately he had withheld from her all
those little evidences of affection to which
she had grown accustomed, and it would
not be hard for him, he would not miss her,
perhaps would even be glad of her absence,
for then he could continue his murderous
schemes without fear of her &#8220;meddling&#8221;
with them.</p>
<p>There was a fascination in the paper on
which was written the signed agreement.
She read it carefully again, and then concealed
it in her bodice, pinning it there so
that it would not become lost. Then she
rose and went into the cabin, placing the
memoranda on a shelf where Dakota would
be sure to find it when he returned with the
doctor. She did not care to read anything
contained in it.</p>
<p>Marveling at her coolness, she went outside
again and resumed her seat on the door
step. It was not such a blow to her, after
all, and there arose in her mind as she sat
on the step a wonder, as to how her father
would act were she to confront him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
evidence of his guilt. Perhaps she would
not show him the paper, but she finally became
convinced that she must talk to him,
must learn from him in some manner his
connection with the attempted murder of
Doubler. Then, after receiving from him
some sign which would convince her, she
would take her belongings and depart for
the East, leaving him to his own devices.</p>
<p>Looking up at the sun, she saw that it
still had quite a distance to travel before it
reached the mountains. Stealing into the
cabin, she once more fixed the bandages on
the wounded man. Then she went out,
mounted her pony, and rode through the
shallow water of the crossing toward the
Double R ranch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>LANGFORD LAYS OFF THE MASK</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun was still an hour above the
horizon when Sheila rode up to the
corral gates. While removing the
saddle and bridle from her pony she noted
with satisfaction that the horse which her
father had been accustomed to ride was inside
the corral. Therefore her father was
somewhere about.</p>
<p>Hanging the saddle and bridle from a
rail of the corral fence, she went into the
house to find that Langford was not there.
Duncan&#8217;s sister curtly informed her that she
had seen him a few minutes before down at
the stables. Sheila went into the office,
which was a lean-to addition to the ranchhouse,
and seating herself at her father&#8217;s
desk picked up a six month&#8217;s old copy of a
magazine and tried to read.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>Finding that she could not concentrate
her thoughts, she dropped the magazine into
her lap and leaned back with a sigh. From
where she sat she had a good view of the
stables, and fifteen minutes later, while she
still watched, she saw Langford come out
of one of the stable doors and walk toward
the house. She felt absolutely no emotion
whatever over his coming; there was only a
mild curiosity in her mind as to the manner
in which he would take the news of her intended
departure from the Double R. She
observed, with a sort of detached interest,
that he looked twice at her saddle and bridle
as he passed them, and so of course he surmised
that she had come in from her ride.
For a moment she lost sight of him behind
some buildings, and then he opened the door
of the office and entered.</p>
<p>He stopped on the threshold for an instant
and looked at her, evidently expecting
her to offer her usual greeting. He frowned
slightly when it did not come, and then
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said cordially. &#8220;You are
back, I see. And tired,&#8221; he added, noting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
her position. He walked over and laid a
hand on her forehead and she involuntarily
shrank from his touch, shuddering, for the
hand which he had placed on her forehead
was the right one&mdash;the hand with which he
had signed the agreement with Dakota&mdash;Doubler&#8217;s
death warrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cross, too?&#8221; he said jocularly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just tired,&#8221; she lied listlessly, and with
an air of great indifference.</p>
<p>He looked critically at her for an instant,
then smiled again and dragged a chair over
near a window and looked out, apparently
little concerned over her manner. But she
noted that he glanced furtively at her several
times, and that he seemed greatly satisfied
over something. She wondered if he
had seen Dakota; if he knew that the latter
had already attempted to carry out the
agreement to &#8220;Persuade Doubler to leave
the county.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride far?&#8221; he questioned, turning and
facing her, his voice casual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The river trail?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>Sheila nodded, and saw a sudden interest
flash into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down,&#8221; she returned. She had not
lied, for she <i>had</i> ridden &#8220;down,&#8221; and
though she had also ridden up the river she
preferred to let him guess a little, for she
resented the curiosity in his voice and was
determined to broach the subject which she
had in mind in her own time and after the
manner that suited her best.</p>
<p>He had not been interested in her for a
long time, had not appeared to care where
she spent her time. Why should he betray
interest now? She saw a mysterious smile
on his face and knew before he spoke that
his apparent interest in her was not genuine&mdash;that
he was merely curious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you haven&#8217;t heard the news?&#8221; he
said softly. He was looking out of the window
now, and she could not see his face.</p>
<p>She took up the magazine and turned
several pages, pretending to read, but in
reality waiting for him to continue. When
he made no effort to do so her own curiosity
got the better of her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; she questioned, without
looking at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;About Doubler,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is
dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her surprise was genuine, and her hands
trembled as the leaves of the magazine
fluttered and closed. Had the nester died
since she had left his cabin? A moment&#8217;s
thought convinced her that this could not
be the explanation, for assuredly she would
have seen anyone who had arrived at Doubler&#8217;s
cabin; she had scanned the surrounding
country before and after leaving the vicinity
of the crossing and had seen no signs of
anyone. Besides, Langford&#8217;s news seemed
to have abided with him a long time&mdash;it
seemed to her that he had known it for
hours. She could not tell why she felt this,
but she was certain that he had not received
word recently&mdash;within an hour or two at
any rate&mdash;unless he had seen Dakota.</p>
<p>This seemed to be the secret of his knowledge,
and the more she considered the latter&#8217;s
excitement during her meeting with
him on the trail, the more fully she became
convinced that Langford had talked to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
The latter&#8217;s anxiety to relieve her of the
task of riding to Lazette for the doctor had
been spurious; he had merely wanted to be
the first to carry the news of Doubler&#8217;s
death to Langford, and after leaving her
he had undoubtedly taken a roundabout
trail for the Double R. Possibly by this
time he had settled with Langford and was
on his way out of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221; she said, turning to Langford.
&#8220;Who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; In her momentary excitement
she had come very near to asking him
who had brought him the news. She hesitated,
for she saw a glint of surprise and
suspicion in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear girl, did I say that he had
been &#8216;killed&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>His smile was without humor. Evidently
he had expected that she had been about to
ask who had killed the nester.</p>
<p>He looked at her steadily, an intolerant
smile playing about the corners of his
mouth. &#8220;I am aware that you have been
suspicious of me ever since you heard that
I had a quarrel with Doubler. But, thank
God, my dear, I have not that crime to answer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
for. Doubler, however, has been
killed&mdash;murdered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila repressed a desire to shudder, and
turned from Langford so that he would not
be able to see the disgust that had come
into her eyes over the discovery that in addition
to being a murderer her father was that
most despicable of all living things&mdash;a hypocrite!
It required all of her composure to
be able to look at him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who killed him?&#8221; she asked evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota!&#8221; She pronounced the name
abstractedly, for she was surprised at the
admission.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that Dakota killed
him?&#8221; she said, looking straight at him.
He changed color, though his manner was
still smooth and his smile bland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan was fortunate enough to be in
the vicinity when the deed was committed,&#8221;
he told her. &#8220;And he saw Dakota shoot
him in the back. With his own rifle, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a quality in his voice which
hinted at satisfaction; a peculiar emphasis
on the word &#8220;fortunate&#8221; which caused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
Sheila to wonder why he should consider it
fortunate that Duncan had seen the murder
done, when it would have been much better
for the success of Dakota&#8217;s and her father&#8217;s
scheme if there had been no witness to it
at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; continued Langford, with a
sigh of resignation that caused Sheila a
shiver of repugnance and horror, &#8220;Doubler&#8217;s
death will not be a very great loss to
the country. Duncan tells me that he has
long been suspected of cattle stealing, and
sooner or later he would have been caught in
the act. And as for Dakota,&#8221; he laughed
harshly, with a note of suppressed triumph
that filled her with an unaccountable resentment;
&#8220;Dakota is an evil in the country,
too. Do you remember how he killed that
Mexican half-breed over in Lazette that
day?&mdash;the day I came? Wanton murder,
I call it. Such a man is a danger and a
menace, and I shall not be sorry to see him
hanged for killing Doubler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will have Duncan charge Dakota
with the murder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, my dear; why shouldn&#8217;t I?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
Assuredly you would not allow Dakota to
go unpunished?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sheila, &#8220;Doubler&#8217;s murderer
should be punished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two things were now fixed in her mind
as certainties. Dakota had not been to see
her father since she had left him on the
river trail; he had not received his blood-money&mdash;would
never receive it. Her father
had no intention of living up to his agreement
with Dakota and intended to allow
him to be hanged. She thought of the
signed agreement in her bodice. Langford
had given it to Dakota, but she had little
doubt that in case Dakota still had it in his
possession and dared to produce it, Langford
would deny having made it&mdash;would
probably term it a forgery. It was harmless,
too; who would be likely to intimate
that the clause regarding Dakota inducing
Doubler to leave the country meant that
Langford had hired Dakota to kill the
nester? Sheila sat silent, looking at Langford,
wondering how it happened that he
had been able to masquerade so long before
her; why she had permitted herself to love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
a being so depraved, so entirely lacking in
principle.</p>
<p>But a thrill of hope swept over her. Perhaps
Doubler would not die? She had been
considering the situation from the viewpoint
of the nester&#8217;s death, but if Dakota had
really been in earnest and had gone for a
doctor, there was a chance that the tragedy
which seemed so imminent would be turned
into something less serious. Immediately
her spirits rose and she was able to smile
quietly at Langford when he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota will be hung, of course; decency
demands it. When Duncan came to me
with the news I sent him instantly to Lazette
to inform the sheriff of what had happened.
Undoubtedly he will take Dakota
into custody at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not for murder,&#8221; said Sheila evenly,
unable to keep a quiver of triumph out of
her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not?&#8221; said Langford, startled. &#8220;Why
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; returned Sheila, enjoying
the sudden consternation that was revealed
in her father&#8217;s face, and drawling her words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
a little to further confound him; &#8220;because
Doubler isn&#8217;t dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not dead!&#8221; Langford&#8217;s jaws sagged,
and he sat looking at Sheila with wide,
staring, vacuous eyes. &#8220;Not dead?&#8221; he
repeated hoarsely. &#8220;Why, Duncan told me
he had examined him, that he had been shot
through the lungs and had bled to death
before he left him! How do you know that
he is not dead?&#8221; he suddenly demanded,
leaning toward her, a wild hope in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to his cabin before noon,&#8221; said
Sheila. &#8220;I found him lying in the doorway.
He had been shot through the right
side, near the shoulder, but not through the
lung, and he was still alive. I dragged him
into the cabin and did what I could for him.
Then I started for the doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the doctor?&#8221; he said incredulously.
&#8220;Then how does it happen that you are
here? You couldn&#8217;t possibly ride to Lazette
and return by this time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I said that I &#8216;started&#8217; for the
doctor,&#8221; said Sheila with a quiet smile. She
was enjoying his excitement. &#8220;I met Dakota
on the trail, and he went.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>Langford continued to stare at her; it
seemed that he could not realize the truth.
Then suddenly he was out of his chair and
standing over her, his face bloated poisonously,
his eyes ablaze with a malignant light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; he shrieked. &#8220;This is
what comes of your infernal meddling!
What business had you to interfere? Why
didn&#8217;t you let him die? I&#8217;ve a notion&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His hands clenched and unclenched before
her eyes, and she sat with blanched
face, certain that he was about to attack
her&mdash;perhaps kill her. She did not seem to
care much, however, and looked up into his
face steadily and defiantly.</p>
<p>After a moment, however, he regained
control of himself, leaving her side and
pacing rapidly back and forth in the office,
cursing bitterly.</p>
<p>Curiously, Sheila was not surprised at
this outburst; she had rather expected it
since she had become aware of his real character.
Nor was she surprised to discover
that he had dropped pretense altogether&mdash;he
was bound to do that sooner or later.
Her only surprise was at her own feelings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
She did not experience the slightest concern
over him&mdash;it was as though she were
talking to a stranger. She was interested
to the point of taking a grim enjoyment
out of his confusion, but beyond that she
was not interested in anything.</p>
<p>It made little difference to her what became
of Langford, Dakota, Duncan&mdash;any
of them, except Doubler. She intended to
return to the nester&#8217;s cabin, to help the doctor
make him comfortable&mdash;for he had been
the only person in the country who had
shown her any kindness; he was the only
one who had not wronged her, and she was
grateful to him.</p>
<p>Langford was standing over her again,
his breath coming short and fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you see Dakota?&#8221; he questioned
hoarsely. &#8220;Answer!&#8221; he added,
when she did not speak immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the river trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you found Doubler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before, yes&mdash;and after. I met him
twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>She discerned his motive in asking these
questions, but it made no difference to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
and she answered truthfully. She did not
intend to shield Dakota; the fact that
Doubler had not been killed outright did
not lessen the gravity of the offense in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you found Doubler!&#8221; Langford&#8217;s
voice came with a vicious snap.
&#8220;You met him coming from Doubler&#8217;s
cabin, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered wearily, &#8220;I met him
coming from there. I was on the trail&mdash;going
there&mdash;and I heard the shot. I know
Dakota killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford made an exclamation of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t so bad, after all. You&#8217;ll
have to be a witness against Dakota. And
very likely Doubler will die&mdash;probably is
dead by this time; will certainly be dead
before the Lazette doctor can reach his
cabin. No, my dear,&#8221; he added, smiling at
Sheila, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t so bad, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila rose. Her poignant anger against
him was equaled only by her disgust. He
expected her to bear witness against Dakota;
desired her to participate in his scheme
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
to fasten upon the latter the entire blame
for the commission of a crime in which he
himself was the moving factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not bear witness against him,&#8221;
she told Langford coldly. &#8220;For I am going
away&mdash;back East&mdash;to-morrow. Don&#8217;t
imagine that I have been in complete ignorance
of what has been going on; that I
have been unaware of the part you have
played in the shooting of Doubler. I have
known for quite a long while that you had
decided to have Doubler murdered, and only
recently I learned that you hired Dakota to
kill him. And this morning, when I met
Dakota on the river trail, he dropped this
from a pocket of his vest.&#8221; She fumbled at
her bodice and produced the signed agreement,
holding it out to him.</p>
<p>As she expected, he repudiated it, though
his face paled a little as he read it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a forgery, my dear,&#8221; he said, in
the old, smooth, even voice that she had
grown to despise.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she returned calmly, &#8220;it is not a
forgery. You forget that only a minute ago
you practically admitted it to be a true
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
agreement by telling me that I should have
allowed Doubler to die. You are an accomplice
in the shooting of Doubler, and if I am
compelled to testify in Dakota&#8217;s trial I shall
tell everything I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She watched while he lighted a match,
held it to the paper, smiling as the licking
flames consumed it. He was entirely composed
now, and through the gathering darkness
of the interior of the office she saw a
sneer come into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall do all I can to assist you to discontinue
the associations which are so distasteful
to you. You will start for the East
immediately, I presume?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In the afternoon.
I shall have my trunks taken over to
Lazette in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning?&#8221; said Langford, puzzled.
&#8220;Why not ride over with them, in
the afternoon, in the buckboard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall ride my pony. The man can return
him.&#8221; She took a step toward the door,
but halted before reaching it, turning to look
back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is necessary for me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
say good-by. But you have not treated me
badly in the past, and I thank you&mdash;for
that&mdash;and wish you well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila had walked to the door and stood
with one hand on the latch. He came and
stood beside her, a suppressed excitement in
his manner, his eyes gleaming brightly in
the dusk which had suddenly fallen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I told you that before. Ben
Doubler is alone, and he needs care. I am
going to him&mdash;to stay with him until the
doctor arrives. He will die if someone does
not take care of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are determined to continue to meddle,
are you?&#8221; he said, his voice quivering
with anger, his lips working strangely. &#8220;I
am sick of your damned interference. Sick
of it, I tell you!&#8221; His voice lowered to a
harsh, throaty whisper. &#8220;You won&#8217;t leave
this office until to-morrow afternoon! Do
you hear? What business is it of yours if
Doubler dies?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila did not answer, but pressed the
door latch. His arm suddenly interposed,
his fingers closing on her arm, gripping it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
so tightly that she cried out with pain. Then
suddenly his fingers were boring into her
shoulders; she was twisted, helpless in his
brutal grasp, and flung bodily into the chair
beside the desk, where she sat, sobbing
breathlessly.</p>
<p>She did not cry out again, but sat motionless,
her lips quivering, rubbing her shoulders
where his iron fingers had sunk into the
flesh, her soul filled with a revolting horror
for his brutality.</p>
<p>For a moment there was no movement.
Then, in the semi-darkness she saw him
leave the door; watched him as he approached
a shelf on which stood a kerosene
lamp, lifted the chimney and applied a
match to the wick. For an instant after
replacing the chimney he stood full in the
glare of light, his face contorted with rage,
his eyes gleaming with venom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know exactly where I stand,
you&mdash;you huzzy!&#8221; he said, grinning satyrically
as she winced under the insult. &#8220;I&#8217;m
your father, damn you! Your father&mdash;do
you hear? And I&#8217;ll not have you go back
East to gab and gossip about me. You&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
stay here, and you&#8217;ll bear witness against
Dakota, and you&#8217;ll keep quiet about me!&#8221;
He was trembling horribly as he came close
to her, and his breath was coughing in his
throat shrilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do anything of the kind!&#8221;
Sheila got to her feet, and stood, rigid with
anger, her eyes flaming defiance. &#8220;I am
going to Doubler&#8217;s cabin this minute, and
if you molest me again I shall go to the
sheriff with my story!&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed about to attack her again, and
his hands were raised as though to grasp her
throat, when there came a sound at the door,
it swung open, and Dakota stepped in, closing
the door behind him.</p>
<p>Dakota&#8217;s face was white&mdash;white as it had
been that other day at the quicksand
crossing when Sheila had looked up to see
him sitting on his pony, watching her.
There was an entire absence of excitement
in his manner, though; no visible sign to tell
that what he had seen on entering the cabin
disturbed him in the least. Yet the whiteness
of his face belied this apparent composure.
It seemed to Sheila that his eyes betrayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
the strong emotion that was gripping
him.</p>
<p>She retreated to the chair beside the desk
and sank into it. Langford had wheeled
and was now facing Dakota, a shallow smile
on his face.</p>
<p>There was a smile on Dakota&#8217;s face, too;
a mysterious, cold, prepared grin that fascinated
Sheila as she watched him. The smile
faded a little when he spoke to Langford,
his voice vibrating, as though he had been
running.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re fighting a woman, Langford,
you ought to make sure there isn&#8217;t a
man around!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mingling with Sheila&#8217;s recognition of the
obvious and admirable philosophy of this
statement was a realization that Dakota
must have been riding hard. There was
much dust on his clothing, the scarf at his
neck was thick with it; it streaked his face,
his voice was husky, his lips dry.</p>
<p>Langford did not answer him, stepping
back against the desk and regarding him
with a mirthless, forced smile which, Sheila
was certain, he had assumed in order to conceal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
his fear of the man who stood before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you haven&#8217;t got any thoughts just at
this minute,&#8221; said Dakota with cold insinuation.
&#8220;You are one of those men who can
talk bravely enough to women, but who can&#8217;t
think of anything exactly proper for a man
to hear. Well, you&#8217;ll do your talking later.&#8221;
He looked at Sheila, ignoring Langford
completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you&#8217;ve been wondering, ma&#8217;am,
why I&#8217;m here, when I ought to be over at
the Two Forks, trying to do something for
Doubler. But the doctor&#8217;s there, taking
care of him. The reason I&#8217;ve come is that
I&#8217;ve found this in Doublet&#8217;s cabin.&#8221; He
drew out the memoranda which Sheila had
placed on the shelf in the cabin, holding it
up so that she might see.</p>
<p>&#8220;You took my vest,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;And
I was looking for it. I found it all right,
but something was missing. You&#8217;re the
only one who has been to Doubler&#8217;s cabin
since I left there, I expect, and it must have
been you who opened this book. It isn&#8217;t in
the same shape it was when you pulled it off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
me when I was talking to you down there
on the river trail&mdash;something has been taken
out of it, a paper. That&#8217;s why I rode over
here&mdash;to see if you&#8217;d got it. Have you,
ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila pointed mutely to the floor, where
a bit of thin, crinkled ash was all that remained
of the signed agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Burned!&#8221; said Dakota sharply.</p>
<p>He caught Sheila&#8217;s nod and questioned
coldly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who burned it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;Mr. Langford,&#8221; returned Sheila.</p>
<p>&#8220;You found it and showed it to him, and
he burned it,&#8221; said Dakota slowly. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; Sheila&#8217;s eyes mocked
Langford as she intercepted his gaze, which
had been fixed on Dakota. &#8220;It was evidence
against him,&#8221; she concluded, indicating her
father.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I see.&#8221; The smile was entirely
gone out of Dakota&#8217;s face now, and as he
turned to look at Langford there was an
expression in his eyes which chilled the
latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve flunked on the agreement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
You&#8217;ve burned it&mdash;won&#8217;t recognize it, eh?
Well, I&#8217;m not any surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford had partially recovered from
the shock occasioned by Dakota&#8217;s unexpected
appearance, and he shook his head in
emphatic, brazen denial.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no agreement between us,
my friend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The paper I burned
was a forgery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota&#8217;s lips hardened. &#8220;You called me
your friend once before, Langford,&#8221; he said
coldly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it again or I&#8217;ll forget
that you are Sheila&#8217;s father. I reckon she
has told you about Doubler. That&#8217;s why I
came over here to get the paper, for I knew
that if you got hold of it you&#8217;d make short
work of it. I know something else.&#8221; He
took a step forward and tried to hold Langford&#8217;s
gaze, his own eyes filled with a snapping
menace. &#8220;I know that you&#8217;ve sent
Duncan to Lazette for the sheriff. The
doctor told me he&#8217;d met him,&mdash;Duncan&mdash;and
the doctor says Duncan told him that
you&#8217;d said that I fixed Doubler. How do
you know I did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan saw you,&#8221; said Langford.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>Dakota&#8217;s lips curled. &#8220;Duncan tell you
that?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>At Langford&#8217;s nod he laughed harshly.
&#8220;So it&#8217;s a plant, eh?&#8221; he said, with a mirthless
chuckle. &#8220;You are figuring to get two
birds with one stone&mdash;Doubler and me.
You&#8217;ve already got Doubler, or think you
have, and now it&#8217;s my turn. It does look
pretty bad for me, for a fact, doesn&#8217;t it?
You&#8217;ve burned the agreement you made
with me, so that you could slip out of your
obligation. I reckon you think that after
the sheriff gets me you&#8217;ll be able to take the
Star without any trouble&mdash;like you expect
to take Doubler&#8217;s land.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got Duncan to swear that he
saw me do for Doubler, and you&#8217;ve got your
daughter to testify that she saw me on the
trail, coming from Doubler&#8217;s cabin right
after she heard the shooting. It was a right
clever scheme, but it was my fault for letting
you get anything on me&mdash;I ought to
have known that you&#8217;d try some dog&#8217;s trick
or other.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was coming rapidly, sharply,
and was burdened with a lashing sarcasm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a right clever scheme, Mister
Langford, and it ought to be successful.
But there&#8217;s one thing you&#8217;ve forgot. I&#8217;ve
lived too long in this country to let anyone
tangle me up like you&#8217;d like to have me.
When a man gets double crossed in this
country, he can&#8217;t go to the law for redress&mdash;he
makes his own laws. I&#8217;m making mine.
You&#8217;ve double crossed me, and damn your
hide, I&#8217;m going to send you over the divide
in a hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>One of his heavy revolvers leaped from
its holster and showed for an instant in his
right hand. Sheila had been watching
closely, forewarned by Dakota&#8217;s manner,
and when she saw his right hand drop to the
holster she sprang upon him, catching the
weapon by the muzzle.</p>
<p>Langford had covered his face with his
hands, and stood beside the desk, trembling,
and Sheila cried aloud in protest when she
saw Dakota draw the weapon that swung
at his other hip, holding her off with the
hand which she had seized. But when Dakota
saw Langford&#8217;s hands go to his face he
hesitated, smiling scornfully. He turned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
Sheila, looking down at her face close to his,
his smile softening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot,&#8221; he said gently; &#8220;I forgot he
is your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t my
father, any more. But&mdash;&#8221; she looked at
Dakota pleadingly&mdash;&#8220;please don&#8217;t shoot
him. Go&mdash;leave the country. You have
plenty of time. You have enough to answer
for. Please go!&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer he grasped her by the shoulders,
swinging her around so that she faced
him,&mdash;as he had forced her to face him that
day on the river trail&mdash;and there was a regretful,
admiring gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You told him&mdash;&#8221; he jerked a thumb toward
Langford&mdash;&#8220;that you wouldn&#8217;t bear
witness against me. I heard you. You&#8217;re a
true blue girl, and your father&#8217;s a fool or he
wouldn&#8217;t lose you, like he is going to lose
you. If I had you I would take mighty
good care that you didn&#8217;t get away from me.
You&#8217;ve given me some mighty good advice,
and I would act on it if I was guilty of shooting
Doubler. But I didn&#8217;t shoot him&mdash;your
father and Duncan have framed up on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
me. Doubler isn&#8217;t dead yet, and so I&#8217;m not
running away. If Doubler had someone to
nurse him, he might&mdash;&#8221; He hesitated and
looked at her with a strange smile. &#8220;You
think I shot Doubler, too, don&#8217;t you? Well,
there&#8217;s a chance that if we can get Doubler
revived he can tell who did shoot him. Do
you want to know the truth? I heard you
say a while ago, while I was standing at the
window, looking in at your father giving a
demonstration of his love for you, that you
intended going over to Doubler&#8217;s shack to
nurse him. If you&#8217;re still of the same mind,
I&#8217;ll take you over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila was at the door in an instant, but
halted on the threshold to listen to Dakota&#8217;s
parting word to Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister man,&#8221; he said enigmatically,
&#8220;there&#8217;s just one thing that I want to say to
you. There&#8217;s a day coming when you&#8217;ll
think thoughts&mdash;plenty of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a flash he had stepped outside the door
and closed it after him.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, still standing beside
the desk, Langford heard the rapid beat of
hoofs on the hard sand of the corral yard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
Faint they became, and their rhythmic beat
faster, until they died away entirely. But
Dakota&#8217;s words still lingered in Langford&#8217;s
mind, and it seemed to him that they conveyed
a prophecy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE PARTING ON THE RIVER TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be leaving you now, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
There was a good moon, and its mellow
light streamed full into Dakota&#8217;s
grim, travel-stained face as he halted
his pony on the crest of a slope above the
Two Forks and pointed out a light that
glimmered weakly through the trees on a
level some distance on the other side of the
river.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Doubler&#8217;s cabin&mdash;where you
see that light,&#8221; he continued, speaking to
Sheila in a low voice. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been there
before, and you won&#8217;t get lost going the rest
of the way alone. Do what you can for
Doubler. I&#8217;m going down to my shack.
I&#8217;ve done a heap of riding to-day, and I
don&#8217;t feel exactly like I want to keep going
on, unless it&#8217;s important. Besides, maybe
Doubler will get along a whole lot better if
I don&#8217;t hang around there. At least, he&#8217;ll
do as well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>Sheila had turned her head from him. He
was exhibiting a perfectly natural aversion
toward visiting the man he had nearly killed,
she assured herself with a shudder, and she
felt no pity for him. He had done her a
service, however, in appearing at the Double
R at a most opportune time, and she was
grateful. Therefore she lingered, finding it
hard to choose words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she finally said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; He maneuvered his pony
until the moonlight streamed in her face. &#8220;I
reckon you&#8217;ve got the same notion as your
father&mdash;that I shot Doubler?&#8221; he said,
watching her narrowly. &#8220;You are willing
to take Duncan&#8217;s word for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan&#8217;s word, and the agreement
which I found in the pocket of your vest,&#8221;
she returned, without looking at him. &#8220;I
suppose that is proof enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said with a bitter laugh, &#8220;it
does look bad for me, for a fact. I can&#8217;t
deny that. And I don&#8217;t blame you for thinking
as you do. But you heard what I told
your father about the shooting of Doubler
being a plant.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A plant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A scheme, a plot&mdash;to make an innocent
man seem guilty. That is what has been
done with me. I didn&#8217;t shoot Doubler. I
wouldn&#8217;t shoot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him now, unbelief in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you would deny it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said resignedly, &#8220;I reckon
that&#8217;s all. I can&#8217;t say that I expected anything
else. I&#8217;ve done some things in my
life that I&#8217;ve regretted, but I&#8217;ve never told a
lie when the truth would do as well. There
is no reason now why I should lie, and so I
want you to know that I am telling the truth
when I say that I didn&#8217;t shoot Doubler.
Won&#8217;t you believe me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she returned, unaffected by the
earnestness in his voice. &#8220;You were at
Doubler&#8217;s cabin when I heard the shot&mdash;I
met you on the trail. You killed that man,
Blanca, over in Lazette, for nothing. You
didn&#8217;t need to kill him; you shot him in pure
wantonness. But you killed Doubler for
money. You would have killed my father
had I not been there to prevent you. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
you can&#8217;t help killing people. You
have my sympathy on that account, and I
hope that in time you will do better&mdash;will
reform. But I don&#8217;t believe you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forgot to mention one other crime,&#8221;
he reminded her in a low voice, not without
a trace of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not forgotten it. I will never
forget it. But I forgive you, for in comparison
to your other crimes your sin against
me was trivial&mdash;though it was great enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again his bitter laugh reached her ears.
&#8220;I thought,&#8221; he began, and then stopped
short. &#8220;Well, I reckon it doesn&#8217;t make
much difference what I thought. I would
have to tell you many things before you
would understand, and even then I suppose
you wouldn&#8217;t believe me. So I am keeping
quiet until&mdash;until the time comes. Maybe
that won&#8217;t be so long, and then you&#8217;ll understand.
I&#8217;ll be seeing you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am leaving this country to-morrow,&#8221;
she informed him coldly.</p>
<p>She saw him start and experienced a sensation
of vindictive satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, with a queer note of regret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
in his voice, &#8220;that&#8217;s too bad. But I
reckon I&#8217;ll be seeing you again anyway, if
the sheriff doesn&#8217;t get me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think they will come for you to-night?&#8221;
she asked, suddenly remembering
that her father had told her that Duncan
had gone to Lazette for the sheriff. &#8220;What
will they do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, I reckon. That is, they won&#8217;t
do anything except take me into custody.
They can&#8217;t do anything until Doubler dies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t die?&#8221; she said. &#8220;What
can they do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually it isn&#8217;t considered a crime to
shoot a man&mdash;if he doesn&#8217;t die. Likely they
wouldn&#8217;t do anything to me if Doubler gets
well. They might want me to leave the
country. But I don&#8217;t reckon that I&#8217;m going
to let them take me&mdash;whether Doubler
dies or not. Once they&#8217;ve got a man it&#8217;s
pretty easy to prove him guilty&mdash;in this
country. Usually they hang a man and
consider the evidence afterward. I&#8217;m not
letting them do that to me. If I was guilty,
I suppose I might look at it differently, but
maybe not.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>Sheila was silent; he became silent, too,
and looked gravely at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be going.&#8221;
He urged his pony forward, but
when it had gone only a few steps he turned
and looked back at her. &#8220;Do your best to
keep Doubler alive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There was a note of the old mockery in
his voice, and it lingered long in Sheila&#8217;s
ears after she had watched him vanish into
the mysterious shadows that surrounded the
trail. Stiffling a sigh of regret and pity,
she spoke to her pony, and the animal
shuffled down the long slope, forded the
river, and so brought her to the door of
Doubler&#8217;s cabin.</p>
<p>The doctor was there; he was bending over
Doubler at the instant Sheila entered the
cabin, and he looked up at her with grave,
questioning eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to nurse him,&#8221; she informed
the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he returned softly; &#8220;he
needs lots of care&mdash;the care that a woman
can give him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he went off into a maze of medical
terms and phrases that left her confused,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
but out of which she gathered the fact that
the bullet had missed a vital spot, that Doubler
was suffering more from shock than
from real injury, and that the only danger&mdash;his
constitution being strong enough to
withstand the shock&mdash;would be from blood
poisoning. He had some fever, the doctor
told Sheila, and he left a small vial on a
shelf with instructions to administer a number
of drops of its contents in a spoonful
of water if Doubler became restless. The
bandages were to be changed several times
a day, and the wound bathed.</p>
<p>The doctor was glad that she had come,
for he had a very sick patient in Mrs. Moreland,
and he must return to her immediately.
He would try to look in in a day or two.
No, he said, in answer to her question, she
could not leave Doubler to-morrow, even
to go home&mdash;if she wanted the patient to get
well.</p>
<p>And so Sheila watched him as he went
out and saddled his horse and rode away
down the river trail. Then with a sigh she
returned to the cabin, closed the door, and
took up her vigil beside the nester.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>SHERIFF ALLEN TAKES A HAND</h3>
</div>

<p>The sheriff&#8217;s posse&mdash;three men whom
he had deputized in Lazette and himself&mdash;had
ridden hard over the twenty
miles of rough trail from Lazette, for Duncan
had assured Allen that he would have
to get into action before Dakota could discover
that there had been a witness to his
deed, and therefore when they arrived at the
edge of the clearing near Dakota&#8217;s cabin at
midnight, they were glad of an opportunity
to dismount and stretch themselves.</p>
<p>There was no light in Dakota&#8217;s cabin, no
sign that the man the sheriff was after was
anywhere about, and the latter consulted
gravely with his men.</p>
<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t going to be any picnic, boys,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to take our time and
keep our eyes open. Dakota ain&#8217;t no spring
chicken, and if he don&#8217;t want to come with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
us peaceable, he&#8217;ll make things plumb lively.&#8221;</p>
<p>A careful examination of the horses in
the corral resulted in the discovery of one
which had evidently been ridden hard and
unsaddled but a few minutes before, for
its flanks were in a lather and steam rose
from its sides.</p>
<p>However, the discovery of the pony told
the sheriff nothing beyond the fact that Dakota
had ridden to the cabin from somewhere,
some time before. Whether he was
asleep, or watching the posse from some
vantage point within or outside of the cabin
was not quite clear. Therefore Allen, the
sheriff, a man of much experience, advised
caution. After another careful reconnoiter,
which settled beyond all reasonable doubt
the fact that Dakota was not secreted in the
timber in the vicinity of the cabin, Allen
told his deputies to remain concealed on the
edge of the clearing, while he proceeded
boldly to the door of the cabin and knocked
loudly. He and Dakota had always been
very friendly.</p>
<p>At the sound of the knock, Dakota&#8217;s voice
came from within the cabin, burdened with
mockery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Allen,&#8221; it said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m locked
up for the night. Can&#8217;t take any chances
on leaving my door unbarred&mdash;can&#8217;t tell
who&#8217;s prowling around. If you&#8217;d sent
word, now, so I would have had time to dress
decently, I might have let you in, seeing it&#8217;s
you. I&#8217;m sure some sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, too.&#8221; Allen grinned at the door.
&#8220;I told the boys you&#8217;d be watching. Well,
it can&#8217;t be helped, I reckon. Only, I&#8217;d like
mighty well to see you. Coming out in the
morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe. Missed my beauty sleep already.&#8221;
His voice was dryly sarcastic.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad you rode this far for nothing;
can&#8217;t even get a look at me. But it&#8217;s no
time to visit a man, anyway. You and your
boys flop outside. We&#8217;ll swap palaver in
the morning. Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen returned to the edge of the clearing,
where he communicated to his men the
result of the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t allowing that he wants to be
disturbed just now,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;And
he&#8217;s too damned polite to monkey with.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
We&#8217;ll wait. Likely he&#8217;ll change his mind
over-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait nothing,&#8221; growled Duncan. &#8220;Bust
the door in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen grinned mildly. &#8220;Good advice,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;Me and my men will set
here while you do the busting. Don&#8217;t imagine
that we&#8217;ll be sore because you take the
lead in such a little matter as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was the sheriff&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; interrupted Allen with a dry
laugh; &#8220;if you was the sheriff. There&#8217;s a
lot of things we&#8217;d do if we was somebody
else. Maybe breaking down Dakota&#8217;s door
is one of them. But we don&#8217;t want anyone
killed if we can help it, and it&#8217;s a dead sure
thing that some one would cash in if we tried
any monkey business with that door. If
you&#8217;re wanting to do something that
amounts to something to help this game
along, swap your cayuse for one of Dakota&#8217;s
and hit the breeze to the Double R for grub.
We&#8217;ll be needing it by the time you get
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan had already ridden over sixty
miles within the past twenty-four hours, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
he made a grumbling rejoinder. But in the
end he roped one of Dakota&#8217;s horses, saddled
it, and presently vanished in the darkness.
Allen and his men built a fire near
the edge of the clearing and rolled into their
blankets.</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock the following morning,
Langford appeared on the river trail, leading
a pack horse loaded with provisions and
cooking utensils for the sheriff and his men.
Duncan, Langford told Allen while they
breakfasted, had sought his bunk, being
tired from the day&#8217;s activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the owner of the Double R?&#8221;
questioned Allen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Dakota friendly?&#8221; he questioned
again, noting Langford&#8217;s nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been quite friendly,&#8221; smiled
Langford.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you ain&#8217;t now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since this has happened. We must
have law and order, even at the price of
friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen squinted a mildly hostile eye at
Langford. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good principle to get
back of&mdash;for a weak-kneed friendship. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
most men who have got friends wouldn&#8217;t let
a little thing like law and order interfere
between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford reddened. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t known
Dakota long of course,&#8221; he defended.
&#8220;Perhaps I erred in saying we were friends.
Acquaintances would better describe it I
think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen&#8217;s eye narrowed again with an emotion
that Langford could not fathom. &#8220;I
always had a heap of faith in Dakota&#8217;s judgment,&#8221;
he said. And then, when Langford&#8217;s
face flushed with a realization of the subtle
insult, Allen said gruffly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You say Doubler&#8217;s dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember to have said that to
you,&#8221; returned Langford, his voice snapping
with rage. &#8220;What I did say was that
Duncan saw him killed and came to me with
the news. I sent him for you. Since then
my daughter has been over to Doubler&#8217;s
cabin. He is quite dead, she reported,&#8221; he
lied. &#8220;There can be no doubt of his guilt,
if that is what bothers you,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;Duncan saw him shoot Doubler in the back
with Doubler&#8217;s own rifle, and my daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
heard the shot and met Dakota coming from
Doubler&#8217;s cabin, immediately after. It&#8217;s a
clear case, it seems to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, clear,&#8221; said Allen. &#8220;The evidence
is all against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet it was not all quite clear to Langford.
To be sure, he had expected to receive news
that Dakota had accomplished the destruction
of Doubler, but he had not anticipated
the fortunate appearance of Duncan at the
nester&#8217;s cabin during the commission of the
murder, nor had he expected Sheila to be
near the scene of the crime. It had turned
out better than he had planned, for since
he had burned the agreement that he had
made with Dakota, the latter had no hold
on him whatever, and if it were finally
proved that he had committed the crime
there would come an end to both Dakota
and Doubler.</p>
<p>Only one thing puzzled him. Dakota
had been to his place, he knew that he was
charged with the murder and that the agreement
had been burned. He also knew that
Duncan and Sheila would bear witness
against him. And yet, though he had had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
an opportunity to escape, he had not done
so. Why not?</p>
<p>He put this interrogation to Allen, carefully
avoiding reference to anything which
would give the sheriff any idea that he possessed
any suspicion that Dakota was not
really guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s bothering me!&#8221; declared
the latter. &#8220;He&#8217;s had time enough to hit
the breeze clear out of the Territory.
Though,&#8221; he added, squinting at Langford,
&#8220;Dakota ain&#8217;t never been much on the run.
He&#8217;d a heap rather face the music. Damn
the cuss!&#8221; he exploded impatiently.</p>
<p>He finished his breakfast in silence, and
then again approached the door of Dakota&#8217;s
cabin, knocking loudly, as before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wanting that palaver now, Dakota,&#8221;
he said coaxingly.</p>
<p>He heard Dakota laugh. &#8220;Have you
viewed the corpse, Allen?&#8221; came his voice,
burdened with mockery.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Allen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a hell of a sheriff&mdash;wanting to
take a man when you don&#8217;t know whether
he&#8217;s done anything.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you ain&#8217;t fooling me none,&#8221;
said Allen slowly. &#8220;The evidence is dead
against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What evidence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan saw you fixing Doubler, and
Langford&#8217;s daughter met you coming from
his cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Langford. He&#8217;s just brought some
grub over.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence that followed Allen&#8217;s words
lasted long, and the sheriff fidgeted impatiently.
When he again spoke there was the
sharpness of intolerance in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If talking to you was all I had to do,
I might monkey around here all summer,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve give you about eight hours
to think this thing over, and that&#8217;s plenty
long enough. I don&#8217;t like to get into any
gun argument with you, because I know that
somebody will get hurt. Why in hell don&#8217;t
you surrender decently? I&#8217;m a friend of
yours and you hadn&#8217;t ought to want to make
any trouble for me. And them&#8217;s good boys
that I&#8217;ve got over there and I wouldn&#8217;t want
to see any of them perforated. And I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
hate like blazes to have to put you out of
business. Why don&#8217;t you act decent and
come out like a man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and look at the corpse,&#8221; insisted Dakota.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be plenty of time to look at the
corpse after you&#8217;re took.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer. Allen sighed regretfully.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
done what I could. From now on, I&#8217;m looking
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, Allen,&#8221; came Dakota&#8217;s
voice. To Allen&#8217;s surprise he heard a fumbling
at the fastenings of the door, and an
instant later it swung open and Dakota stood
in the opening, one of his six-shooters in
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I know you well enough to be
tolerably sure that you&#8217;ll get me before you
leave here,&#8221; he said, as Allen wheeled and
faced him, his arms folded over his chest as
a declaration of his present peaceful intentions.
&#8220;But I want you to get this business
straight before anything is started.
And then you&#8217;ll be responsible. I&#8217;m giving
it to you straight. Somebody&#8217;s framed up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
on me. I didn&#8217;t shoot Doubler. When I
left him he was cleaning his rifle. After
I left him I heard shooting. I thought it
was him trying his rifle, or I would have
gone back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I met Sheila Langford on the
river trail, near the cabin. She&#8217;d heard the
shooting, too. She thinks I did it. You
think I did it, and Duncan says he saw
me do it. Doubler isn&#8217;t dead. At least he
wasn&#8217;t dead when I left the doctor with him
at sundown. But he wasn&#8217;t far from it,
and if he dies without coming to it&#8217;s likely
that things will look bad for me. But because
I knew he wasn&#8217;t dead I took a chance
on staying here. I am not allowing that
I&#8217;m going to let anyone hang me for a thing
I didn&#8217;t do, and so if you&#8217;re determined to
get me without making sure that Doubler&#8217;s
going to have mourners immediately, it&#8217;s a
dead sure thing that some one&#8217;s going to get
hurt. I reckon that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ve given you
fair warning, and after you get back to the
edge of the clearing our friendship don&#8217;t
count any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped back and closed the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>Allen walked slowly toward the clearing,
thinking seriously. He said nothing to
Langford or his men concerning his conversation
with Dakota, and though he covertly
questioned the former he could discover
nothing more than that which the Double
R owner had already told him. Several
times during the morning he was on the
point of planning an attack on the cabin,
but Dakota&#8217;s voice had a ring of truth in it
and he delayed action, waiting for some more
favorable turn of events.</p>
<p>And so the hours dragged. The men
lounged in the shade of the trees and talked;
Langford&mdash;though he had no further excuse
for staying&mdash;remained, concealing his
impatience over Allen&#8217;s inaction by taking
short rides, but always returning; Allen,
taciturn, morose even, paid no attention to
him.</p>
<p>The afternoon waned; the sun descended
to the peaks of the mountains, and there was
still inaction on Allen&#8217;s part, still silence
from the cabin. Just at sundown Allen
called his men to him and told them to guard
the cabin closely, not to shoot unless forced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
by Dakota, but to be certain that he did not
escape.</p>
<p>He said they might expect him to return
by dawn of the following morning. Then,
during Langford&#8217;s absence on one of his
rides, he loped his pony up the river trail
toward Ben Doubler&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>DOUBLER TALKS</h3>
</div>

<p>After the departure of the doctor
Sheila entered the cabin and closed
the door, fastening the bars and drawing
a chair over near the table. Doubler
seemed to be resting easier, though there
was a flush in his cheeks that told of the
presence of fever. However, he breathed
more regularly and with less effort than before
the coming of the doctor, and as a consequence,
Sheila felt decidedly better. At
intervals during the night she gave him
quantities of the medicine which the doctor
had left, but only when the fever seemed to
increase, forcing the liquid through his lips.
Several times she changed the bandages,
and once or twice during the night when he
moaned she pulled her chair over beside him
and smoothed his forehead, soothing him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
When the dawn came it found her heavy
eyed and tired.</p>
<p>She went to the river and procured fresh
water, washed her hands and face, prepared
a breakfast of bacon and soda biscuit&mdash;which
she found in a tin box in a corner of
the cabin, and then, as Doubler seemed to
be doing nicely, she saddled her pony and
took a short gallop. Returning, she entered
the cabin, to find Doubler tossing restlessly.</p>
<p>She gave him a dose of the medicine&mdash;an
extra large one&mdash;but it had little effect,
quieting him only momentarily. Evidently
he was growing worse. The thought
aroused apprehension in her mind, but she
fought it down and stayed resolutely at the
sick man&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>Through the slow-dragging hours of the
morning she sat beside him, giving him the
best care possible under the circumstances,
but in spite of her efforts the fever steadily
rose, and at noon he sat suddenly up in the
bunk and gazed at her with blazing, vacuous
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Dakota&#8217;s
square!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>Sheila stifled a scream of fear and shrank
from him. But recovering, she went to him,
seizing his shoulders and forcing him back
into the bunk. He did not resist, not seeming
to pay any attention to her at all, but he
mumbled, inexpressively:</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t so, I tell you. He&#8217;s just left
me, an&#8217; any man which could talk like he
talked to me ain&#8217;t&mdash;I reckon not,&#8221; he said,
shaking his head with a vigorous, negative
motion; &#8220;you&#8217;re a heap mistaken&mdash;you ain&#8217;t
got him right at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was quiet for a time after this, but
toward the middle of the afternoon Sheila
saw that his gaze was following her as she
paced softly back and forth in the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re stuck on that Langford girl,
are you?&#8221; he demanded, laughing. &#8220;Well,
it won&#8217;t do you any good, Dakota, she&#8217;s&mdash;well,
she&#8217;s some sore at you for something.
She won&#8217;t listen to anything which is said
about you.&#8221; The laughter died out of his
eyes; they became cold with menace. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t listenin&#8217; to any more of that sorta talk,
I tell you! I&#8217;ve got my eyes open. Why!&#8221;
he said in surprise, starting up, &#8220;he&#8217;s gone!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
He suddenly shuddered and cursed. &#8220;In
the back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And
profanity gushed from his lips. Then he
collapsed, closing his eyes, and lay silent
and motionless.</p>
<p>Out of the jumble of disconnected sentences
Sheila was able to gather two things
of importance&mdash;perhaps three.</p>
<p>The first was that some one had told him
of Dakota&#8217;s complicity in the plan to murder
him and that he refused to believe his
friend capable of such depravity. The second
was that he knew who had shot him; he
also knew the man who had informed him
of Dakota&#8217;s duplicity&mdash;though this knowledge
would amount to very little unless he
recovered enough to be able to supply the
missing threads.</p>
<p>Sheila despaired of him supplying anything,
for it seemed that he was steadily
growing worse, and when the dusk came she
began to feel a dread of remaining with him
in the cabin during the night. If only the
doctor would return! If Dakota would
come&mdash;Duncan, her father, anybody! But
nobody came, and the silence around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
cabin grew so oppressive that she felt she
must scream. When darkness succeeded
dusk she lighted the kerosene lamp, placed a
bar over the window, secured the door fastenings,
and seated herself at the table, determined
to take a short nap.</p>
<p>It seemed that she had scarcely dropped
off to sleep&mdash;though in reality she had been
unconscious for more than two hours&mdash;when
she awoke suddenly, to see Doubler sitting
erect in the bunk, watching her with a wan,
sympathetic smile. There was the light of
reason in his eyes and her heart gave an ecstatic
leap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you give me a drink of water,
ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he said, in the voice that she knew
well.</p>
<p>She sprang to the pail, to find that it contained
very little. She had lifted it, and
was about to unfasten the door, intending
to go to the river to procure fresh water,
when Doubler&#8217;s voice arrested her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some water there&mdash;I can hear it
splashin&#8217;: It&#8217;ll do well enough just now. I
don&#8217;t want much. You can get some fresh
after a while. I want to talk to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>She placed the pail down and went over
to him, standing beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been here? I
knowed you was here all the time&mdash;I kept
seein&#8217; you, but somehow things was a little
mixed. But I know that you&#8217;ve been here
quite a while. How long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the second night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You found me layin&#8217; there&mdash;in the door.
I dropped there, not bein&#8217; able to go any
further. I felt you touchin&#8217; me&mdash;draggin&#8217;
me. There was someone else here, too.
Who was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor and Dakota.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Dakota now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At his cabin, I suppose. He didn&#8217;t stay
here long&mdash;he left right after he brought the
doctor. I imagine you know why he didn&#8217;t
stay. He was afraid that you would recognize
him and accuse him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Accuse him of what, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of shooting you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;I reckon, ma&#8217;am, that you
don&#8217;t understand. It wasn&#8217;t Dakota that
shot me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who did, then?&#8221; she questioned eagerly.
&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she said, sitting suddenly
erect, a mysterious elation filling her,
her eyes wide with surprise and delight, and
a fear that Doubler might have been mistaken&mdash;&#8220;Why,
I saw Dakota on the river
trail just after you were shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d just left me. He hadn&#8217;t been
gone more than ten minutes or so when Duncan
rode up&mdash;comin&#8217; out of the timber just
down by the crick. Likely he&#8217;d been hidin&#8217;
there. I was cleanin&#8217; my rifle; we had
words, and when I set my rifle down just
outside the shack, he grabbed it an&#8217; shot
me. After that I don&#8217;t seem to remember
a heap, except that someone was touchin&#8217;
me&mdash;which must have been you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am <i>so</i> glad!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was thinking now of Dakota&#8217;s parting
words to her the night before on the
crest of the slope above the river,&mdash;of his
words, of the truth of his statement denying
his guilt, and she was glad that she had not
spoken some of the spiteful things which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
had been in her mind. How she had misjudged
him!</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s something to be glad for,&#8221;
smiled Doubler, misunderstanding her elation,
&#8220;but I reckon I owe it to you&mdash;I&#8217;d
have pulled my freight sure, if you hadn&#8217;t
come when you did. An&#8217; I told you not to
be comin&#8217; here any more.&#8221; He laughed.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it odd how things turn out&mdash;sometimes.
I&#8217;d have died sure,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to live a long while,&#8221; she
said. And then, to his surprise, she bent
over and kissed his forehead, leaving his side
instantly, her cheeks aflame, her eyes alight
with a mysterious fire. To conceal her emotion
from Doubler she seized the water pail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will get some fresh water,&#8221; she said,
with a quick, smiling glance at him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
want a fresh drink, and your bandages must
be changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened the door and stepped down
into the darkness.</p>
<p>There was a moon, and the trail to the
river was light enough for her to see plainly,
but when she reached the timber clump in
which Doubler had said Duncan had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
hiding, she shuddered and made a detour to
avoid passing close to it. This took her
some distance out of her way, and she reached
the river and walked along its bank for a
little distance, searching for a deep accessible
spot into which she could dip the pail.</p>
<p>The shallow crossing over which she had
ridden many times was not far away, and
when she stooped to fill the pail she heard
a sudden clatter and splashing, and looked
up to see a horseman riding into the water
from the opposite side of the river.</p>
<p>He saw her at the instant she discovered
him, and once over the ford he turned his
horse and rode directly toward her.</p>
<p>After gaining the bank he halted his pony
and looked intently at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Langford&#8217;s daughter, I reckon,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she returned, seeing that he was
a stranger; &#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Ben Allen,&#8221; he said shortly; &#8220;the
sheriff of this county. What are you doing
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am taking care of Ben Doubler,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;he has been&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then he ain&#8217;t dead, of course,&#8221; said Allen,
interrupting her. It seemed to Sheila
that there was relief and satisfaction in his
voice, and she peered closer at him, but his
face was hidden in the shadow of his hat
brim.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very much better now,&#8221; she told
him, scarcely able to conceal her delight.
&#8220;But he has been very bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Able to talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He has just been talking to me.&#8221;
She took a step toward him, speaking earnestly
and rapidly. &#8220;I suppose you are
looking for Dakota,&#8221; she said, remembering
what her father had told her about sending
Duncan to Lazette for the sheriff. &#8220;If you
are looking for him, I want to tell you that
he didn&#8217;t shoot Doubler. It was Duncan.
Doubler told me so not over five minutes
ago. He said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Allen had spurred his pony forward,
and before she could finish he was out of
hearing distance, riding swiftly toward the
cabin.</p>
<p>Sheila lingered at the water&#8217;s edge, for
now suddenly she saw much beauty in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
surrounding country, and she was no longer
lonesome. She stood on the bank of the
river, gazing long at the shadowy rims of
the distant mountains, at their peaks, rising
majestically in the luminous mist of the
night; at the plains, stretching away and
fading into the mysterious shadows of the
distance; watching the waters of the river,
shimmering like quicksilver&mdash;a band of
glowing ribbon winding in and out and
around the moon-touched buttes of the canyons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said irrelevantly, &#8220;he isn&#8217;t so
bad, after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stooping over again to fill the pail, she
heard a sharp clatter of hoofs behind her.
A horseman was racing toward the river&mdash;toward
her&mdash;bending low over his pony&#8217;s
mane, riding desperately. She placed the
pail down and watched him. Apparently
he did not see her, for, swerving suddenly,
he made for the crossing without slackening
speed. He had almost reached the
water&#8217;s edge when there came a spurt of
flame from the door of Doubler&#8217;s cabin, followed
by the sharp whip like crack of a rifle!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>In the doorway of the cabin, clearly outlined
against the flickering light of the interior,
was a man. And as Sheila watched
another streak of fire burst from the door,
and she heard the shrill sighing of the bullet,
heard the horseman curse. But he did
not stop in his flight, and in an instant he
had crossed the river. She saw him for an
instant as he was outlined against the clear
sky in the moonlight that bathed the crest
of the slope, and then he was gone.</p>
<p>Dropping the pail, Sheila ran toward the
cabin, fearing that Doubler had suddenly
become delirious and had attacked Allen.
But it seemed to her that it had not been
Allen who had raced away from the cabin,
and she had not gone more than half way
toward it when she saw another horseman
coming. She halted to wait for him, and
when he halted and drew up beside her she
saw that it was the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; she demanded, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duncan!&#8221; Allen cursed picturesquely
and profanely. &#8220;When I got to the shack
he was inside, standing over Doubler, strangling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
him. The damned skunk! You was
right,&#8221; he added; &#8220;it was him who shot
Doubler!&#8221; He continued rapidly, grimly,
taking a piece of paper from a pocket and
writing something on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My men have got Dakota corraled in
his cabin. If he tries to get away they will
do for him. I don&#8217;t want that to happen;
there&#8217;s too few square men in the country
as it is. Take this&#8221;&mdash;he held out the paper
to her&mdash;&#8220;and get down to Dakota&#8217;s cabin
with it. Give it to Bud&mdash;one of my men&mdash;and
tell him to scatter the others and try to
head off Duncan if he comes that way. I&#8217;m
after him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The paper fluttered toward her, she
snatched at it, missed it, and stooped to take
it from the ground. When she stood erect
she saw Allen and his pony silhouetted for
an instant on the crest of the ridge on the
other side of the river. Then he vanished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>FOR DAKOTA</h3>
</div>

<p>Though in a state of anxiety and excitement
over the incident of Duncan&#8217;s
attack on Doubler and the subsequent
shooting, together with a realization
of Dakota&#8217;s danger, Sheila did not lose her
composure. She ran to the river and secured
the water, aware that it might be
needed now more than ever. Then, hurrying
as best she could with the weight of the
pail, she returned to the cabin.</p>
<p>She was relieved to find that Doubler had
received no injury, and she paused long
enough to allow him to tell her that Duncan
had entered the cabin shortly after she had
left it. He had attacked Doubler, but had
been interrupted by Allen, who had suddenly
ridden up. Duncan had heard him
coming, and had concealed himself behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
the door, and when Allen had entered Duncan
had struck him on the head with the butt
of his six-shooter, knocking him down. The
blow had been a glancing one, however,
and Allen had recovered quickly, seizing
Doubler&#8217;s rifle and trying to bring down the
would be murderer as he fled.</p>
<p>While attending to Doubler&#8217;s bandages,
Sheila repeated the conversation she had
had with Allen concerning the situation in
which he had left Dakota, and instantly the
nester&#8217;s anxiety for his friend took precedence
over any thoughts for his own immediate
welfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be trouble sure, now that Allen&#8217;s
left there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dakota won&#8217;t
be a heap easy with them deputies.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told Sheila to let the bandaging go
until later, but she refused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dakota&#8217;ll be needin&#8217; you a heap more
than I need you,&#8221; he insisted, refusing to allow
her to touch the bandages. &#8220;There&#8217;ll
be the devil to pay if any of them deputies
try to rush Dakota&#8217;s shack. I want you to
go down there right now. If you wait, it&#8217;ll
mebbe be too late.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>Sheila hesitated for a moment, and then,
yielding to the entreaty in Doubler&#8217;s eyes,
she was at his side, pressing his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride ma&#8217;am!&#8221; he told her, when she was
ready to go, his cheeks flushed with excitement,
his eyes bright.</p>
<p>Her pony snorted with surprise when she
brought her riding whip down against its
flanks when turning from the corral gates,
but it needed no second urging, and its pace
when it splashed through the shallow water
of the crossing was fully as great as that of
Duncan&#8217;s pony, which had previously passed
through it.</p>
<p>Once on the hard sand of the river trail
it settled into a long, swinging gallop, under
which the miles flew by rapidly and
steadily. Sheila drew the animal up on the
rises, breathing it sometimes, but on the levels
she urged it with whip and spur, and in
something more than an hour after leaving
Doubler&#8217;s cabin, she flashed by the quicksand
crossing, which she estimated as being
not more than twelve miles from her journey&#8217;s
end.</p>
<p>She was tired after her long vigil at Doubler&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
side, but the weariness was entirely
physical, for her brain was working rapidly,
filling her thoughts with picturesque conjectures,
drawing pictures in which she saw
Dakota being shot down by Allen&#8217;s deputies.
And he was innocent!</p>
<p>She did not blame herself for Dakota&#8217;s
dilemma, though she felt a keen regret over
her treatment of him, over her unjust suspicions.
He had really been in earnest
when he had told her the night before on the
river trail that he was not guilty&mdash;that
everybody had misjudged him. Vivid in
her recollection was the curious expression
on his face when he had said to her just before
leaving her that night:</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you believe me?&#8221;</p>
<p>And that other time, when he had taken
her by the shoulders and looked steadily
into her eyes&mdash;she remembered that, too;
she could almost feel his fingers, and the
words he had uttered then were fresh in her
memory: &#8220;I&#8217;ve treated you mean, Sheila,
about as mean as a man could treat a
woman. I am sorry. I want you to believe
that. And maybe some day&mdash;when this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
business is over&mdash;you&#8217;ll understand, and forgive
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been mystery in his actions
ever since she had seen him the first time,
and though she could not yet understand it,
she had discovered that there were forces at
work in his affairs which seemed to indicate
that he had not told her that for the purpose
of attempting to justify his previous
actions.</p>
<p>Evidently, whatever the mystery that surrounded
him, her father and Duncan were
concerned in it, and this thought spurred her
on, for it gave her a keen delight to think
that she was arrayed against them, even
though she were on the side of the man who
had wronged her. He, at least, had not
been concerned in the plot to murder Doubler.</p>
<p>When she reached the last rise&mdash;on the
crest of which she had sat on her pony on
the morning following her marriage to Dakota
in the cabin and from which she had
seen the parson riding away&mdash;she was
trembling with eagerness and dread for fear
that something might happen before she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
could arrive. It was three miles down the
slope, and when she reached the level there
was Dakota&#8217;s cabin before her.</p>
<p>She drew her pony to a walk, for she saw
men grouped in front of the cabin door,
saw Dakota there himself, standing in the
open doorway, framed in the light from
within. There were no evidences of the conflict
which she had dreaded. She had arrived
in time.</p>
<p>Convinced of this, she felt for the first
time her physical weariness, and she leaned
forward on her pony, holding to its mane
for support, approaching the cabin slowly.</p>
<p>Her father was there, she observed, as
she drew nearer; and three strangers&mdash;and
Allen! And near Allen, sitting on his
horse dejectedly, was Duncan!</p>
<p>One of Duncan&#8217;s arms swung oddly at
his side, and Sheila thought instantly of his
curse when he had been riding near her at
the river crossing. Evidently Allen&#8217;s bullet
had struck him.</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s presence at Dakota&#8217;s cabin was
now unnecessary, for it was evident that an
understanding had been reached with Allen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
and Sheila experienced a sudden aversion
to appearing among the men. Turning her
pony, she was about to ride away, intending
to return to Doubler&#8217;s cabin, when Allen
turned and saw her. He spurred quickly
to her side, seizing the pony by the bridle
rein and leading it toward the cabin door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I got
him. Holy smoke!&#8221; he exclaimed as she
came within the radius of the light. &#8220;You
certainly rode some, didn&#8217;t you, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer. She saw her father
look at her, noted his start, smiled scornfully
when she observed a paleness overspreading
his face. She looked from him
to Duncan, and the latter flushed and turned
his head. Then Allen&#8217;s voice reached her,
as he spoke to Dakota.</p>
<p>&#8220;This young woman has rode twenty
miles to-night&mdash;to save your hide&mdash;you
durned cuss. If you was anyways hospitable,
you&#8217;d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen&#8217;s voice seemed to grow distant to
Sheila, the figures of the men in the group
blurred, the light danced, she reeled in the
saddle, tried to check herself, failed, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
toppled limply forward over her pony&#8217;s
neck. She heard an exclamation, saw Dakota
spring suddenly from the doorway, felt
his arms around her. She struggled in his
grasp, trying to fight him off, and then she
drifted into oblivion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>SOME MEMORIES</h3>
</div>

<p>When Sheila recovered consciousness
she was in Dakota&#8217;s cabin&mdash;in
the bunk in which she had lain
on another night in the yesterday of her life
in this country. She recognized it instantly.
There was the candle on the table, there were
the familiar chairs, the fireplace, the shelves
upon which were Dakota&#8217;s tobacco tins and
matches; there was the guitar, with its
gaudy string, suspended from the wall. If
it had been raining, she might have imagined
that she was just awakening from a sleep
in that other time. She felt a hand on her
forehead, a damp cloth, and she opened her
eyes to gaze fairly into Dakota&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please,&#8221; she said, shrinking from
him.</p>
<p>It occurred to her that she had uttered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
the same words to him before, and, closing
her eyes for a moment, she remembered. It
had been when he had tried to assist her out
of the water at the quicksand crossing, and
as on that occasion, his answer was the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lay for a long time, looking straight
up at the ceiling, utterly tired, wondering
vaguely what had become of her father,
Duncan, Allen, and the others. She would
have given much to have been able to lie
there for a time&mdash;a long time&mdash;and rest. But
that was not to be thought of. She struggled
to a sitting position, and when her eyes had
become accustomed to the light she saw her
father sitting in a chair near the fireplace.
The door was closed&mdash;barred. Sheila
glanced again at her father, and then questioningly
at Dakota, who was watching her
from the center of the room, his face inscrutable.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean? Where are the
others?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allen and his men have gone back to
Lazette,&#8221; returned Dakota quietly. &#8220;This
means&#8221;&mdash;he pointed to Langford&mdash;&#8220;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
we&#8217;re going to have a little talk&mdash;about
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila rose. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to hear any
talk; I am not interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be interested in <i>my</i> talk,&#8221; said
Dakota.</p>
<p>Curiously, he seemed to be invested with
a new character. Just now he was more
like the man he had been the night she had
met him the first time&mdash;before he had forced
her to marry him&mdash;than he had been since.
Only, she felt as she watched him standing
quietly in the middle of the room, the recklessness
which had marked his manner that
other time seemed to have entirely disappeared,
seemed to have been replaced by
something else&mdash;determination.</p>
<p>Beneath the drooping mustache Sheila
saw the lines of his lips; they had always
seemed hard to her, and now there were little
curves at the corners which hinted at
amusement&mdash;grim amusement. His eyes,
too, were different; the mockery had departed
from them. They were steady and
unwavering, as before, and though they still
baffled her, she was certain that she saw a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
slumbering devil in them&mdash;as though he possessed
some mysterious knowledge and purposed
to confound Sheila and her father
with it, though in his own way and to suit
his convenience. Yet behind it all there
lurked a certain gravity&mdash;a cold deliberation
that seemed to proclaim that he was in
no mood to trifle and that he proposed to
follow some plan and would brook no interference.</p>
<p>Fascinated by the change in him Sheila resumed
her seat on the edge of the bunk,
watching him closely. He drew a chair over
near the door, tilted it back and dropped
into it, thus mutely announcing that he intended
keeping the prisoners until he had
delivered himself of that mysterious knowledge
which seemed to be in his mind.</p>
<p>Glancing furtively at her father, Sheila
observed that he appeared to have formed
some sort of a conclusion regarding Dakota&#8217;s
actions also, for he sat very erect on his
chair, staring at the latter, an intense interest
in his eyes.</p>
<p>Sheila had become interested, too; she had
forgotten her weariness. And yet Dakota&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
first words disappointed her&mdash;somehow they
seemed irrelevant.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t such a big world, after all,
is it?&#8221; He addressed both Sheila and her
father, though he looked at neither. His
tone was quietly conversational, and when
he received no answer to his remark he looked
up with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has been said by a great many
people, hasn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve heard it many times.
I reckon you have, too. But it&#8217;s a fact,
just the same. The world <i>is</i> a small place.
Take us three. You&#8221;&mdash;he said, pointing
to Langford&mdash;&#8220;come out here from Albany
and buy a ranch. You&#8221;&mdash;he smiled at
Sheila&mdash;&#8220;came with your father as a matter
of course. You&#8221;&mdash;he looked again at
Langford&mdash;&#8220;might have bought a ranch in
another part of the country. You didn&#8217;t
need to buy this particular one. But you
did. Take me. I spent five years in Dakota
before I came here. I&#8217;ve been here five
years.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man up in Dakota wanted me to stay
there; said he&#8217;d do most anything for me if I
would. But I didn&#8217;t like Dakota; something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
kept telling me that I ought to move
around a little. I came here, I liked the
place, and I&#8217;ve stayed here. I know that
neither of you are very much interested in
what has happened to me, but I&#8217;ve told you
that much just to prove my contention about
the world being a small place. It surely
isn&#8217;t so very big when you consider that three
persons can meet up like we&#8217;ve met&mdash;our
trails leading us to the same section of the
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how that concerns us,&#8221; said
Langford impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Dakota, and now there
was a note of sarcasm in his voice, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t see. Lots of folks don&#8217;t see. But
there are trails that lead everywhere. Fate
marks them out&mdash;blazes them. There are
trails that lead us into trouble, others that
lead us to pleasure&mdash;straight trails, crooked
ones, trails that cross&mdash;all kinds. Folks
start out on a crooked trail, trying to get
away from something, but pretty soon another
trail crosses the one they are on&mdash;maybe
it will be a straight one that crosses
theirs, with a straight man riding it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The man riding the crooked trail and
the man riding the straight one meet at the
place where the trails cross. Such trails
don&#8217;t lead to any to-morrow; they are yesterday&#8217;s
trails, and before the man riding
the crooked trail and the man riding the
straight trail can go any further there has
got to be an accounting. That is what has
happened here. You&#8221;&mdash;he smiled gravely
as he looked at Langford&mdash;&#8220;have been riding
a crooked trail. I have been hanging onto
the straight one as best I could. Now we&#8217;ve
got to where the trails cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that you want an explanation
of my action in burning that signed agreement,
I suppose?&#8221; sneered Langford, looking
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still trying to ride the crooked trail?&#8221;
smiled Dakota, with the first note of mockery
that Sheila had heard in his voice since
he had begun speaking. &#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying
a bit about that agreement. Why, man,
I&#8217;d have shot myself before I&#8217;d have shot
Doubler. He&#8217;s my friend&mdash;the only real
friend I&#8217;ve had in ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then when you signed the agreement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
you didn&#8217;t mean to keep it?&#8221; questioned
Langford incautiously, disarmed by Dakota&#8217;s
earnestness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years ago a boy named Ned Keegles
went to Dakota. I am glad to see that you
are familiar with the name,&#8221; he added with
a smile as Langford started and stiffened
in his chair, his face suddenly ashen. &#8220;You
knowing Keegles will save me explaining a
lot,&#8221; continued Dakota. &#8220;Well, Keegles
went to Dakota&mdash;where I was. He was
eighteen and wasn&#8217;t very strong, as young
men go. But he got a job punching cows
and I got to know him pretty well&mdash;used to
bunk with him. He took a liking to me because
I took an interest in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t like the work, because he had
been raised differently. He lived in Albany
before he went West. His father, William
Keegles, was in the hardware business with
a man named Langford&mdash;David Dowd
Langford. You see, I couldn&#8217;t be mistaken
in the name of the man; it&#8217;s such an uncommon
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled significantly at Sheila, and an
odd expression came into her face, for she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
remembered that on the night of her coming
he had made the same remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day Ned Keegles got sick and took
me into his confidence. He wasn&#8217;t in the
West for his health, he said. He was a
fugitive from the law, accused of murdering
his father. It wasn&#8217;t a nice story to hear,
but he told it, thinking he was going to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota smiled enigmatically at Sheila
and coldly at the now shrinking man seated
in the chair beside the fireplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day Keegles went into his father&#8217;s
office. His father&#8217;s partner, David Dowd
Langford, was there, talking to his father.
They&#8217;d had hard words. Keegle&#8217;s father
had discovered that Langford had appropriated
a large sum of the firm&#8217;s money.
By forging his partner&#8217;s signature he had
escaped detection until one day when the
elder Keegles had accidentally discovered
the fraud&mdash;which was the day on which Ned
Keegles visited his father. It isn&#8217;t necessary
to go into detail, but it was perfectly
plain that Langford was guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were hard words, as I have said.
The elder Keegles threatened to prosecute.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
Langford seized a sample knife that had
been lying on the elder Keegle&#8217;s desk, and
stabbed him, killing him instantly. Then,
while Ned Keegles stood by, stunned by the
suddenness of the attack, Langford coolly
walked to a telephone and notified the police
of the murder. Hanging up the receiver, he
raised the hue and cry, and a dozen clerks
burst into the office, to find Ned Keegles
bending over his father, trying to withdraw
the knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Langford accused Ned Keegles of the
murder. He protested, of course, but seeing
that the evidence was against him, he
fought his way out of the office and escaped.
He went to Dakota&mdash;where I met him.&#8221;
He hesitated and looked steadily at Langford.
&#8220;Do you see how the trails have
crossed? The crooked one and the straight
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford was leaning forward in his
chair, a scared, wild expression in his eyes,
his teeth and hands clenched in an effort to
control his emotions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t kill
him! Ned Keegles&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Dakota rose from his chair and
walked to a shelf, from which he took a box,
returning to Langford&#8217;s side and opening it.
He drew out a knife, shoving it before
Langford&#8217;s eyes and pointing out some rust
spots on the blade.</p>
<p>&#8220;This knife was given to me by Ned
Keegles,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;These rust spots
on the blade are from his father&#8217;s blood.
Look at them!&#8221; he said sharply, for Langford
had turned his head.</p>
<p>At the command he swung around, his
gaze resting on the knife. &#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty
story,&#8221; he sneered.</p>
<p>Dakota&#8217;s laugh when he returned the
knife to the box chilled Sheila as that same
laugh had chilled her when she had heard it
during her first night in the country&mdash;in this
same cabin, with Dakota sitting at the table&mdash;a
bitter, mocking laugh that had in it a
savagery controlled by an iron will. He
turned abruptly and walked to his chair,
seating himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s a pretty story. But
it hasn&#8217;t all been told. With a besmirched
name and the thoughts which were with him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
all the time, life wasn&#8217;t exactly a joyful one
for Ned Keegles. He was young, you see,
and it all preyed on his mind. But after a
while it hardened him. He&#8217;d hit town with
the rest of the boys, and he&#8217;d drink whiskey
until he&#8217;d forget. But he couldn&#8217;t forget
long. He kept seeing his father and Langford;
nights he&#8217;d start from his blankets,
living over and over again the incident of
the murder. He got so he couldn&#8217;t stay in
Dakota. He came down here and tried to
forget. It was just the same&mdash;there was no
forgetfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;One night when he was on the trail near
here, he met a woman. It was raining and
the woman had lost the trail. He took the
woman in. She interested him, and he questioned
her. He discovered that she was the
daughter of the man who had murdered his
father&mdash;the daughter of David Dowd Langford!&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford cringed and looked at Sheila,
who was looking straight at Dakota, her
eyes alight with knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ned Keegles kept his silence, as he had
kept it for ten years,&#8221; resumed Dakota.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
&#8220;But the coming of the woman brought
back the bitter memories, and while the
woman slept in his cabin he turned to the
whiskey bottle for comfort. As he drank
his troubles danced before him&mdash;magnified.
He thought it would be a fine revenge if he
should force the woman to marry him, for
he figured that it would be a blow at the
father&#8217;s pride. If it hadn&#8217;t been for a cowardly
parson and the whiskey the marriage
would never have occurred&mdash;Ned Keegles
would not have thought of it. But he didn&#8217;t
hurt the woman; she left him pure as she
came&mdash;mentally and physically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Langford slowly rose from his chair, his
lips twitching, his face working strangely,
his eyes wide and glaring.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say she married him&mdash;Ned Keegles?&#8221;
he said, his voice high keyed and
shrill. He turned to Sheila after catching
Dakota&#8217;s nod. &#8220;Is this true?&#8221; he demanded
sharply. &#8220;Did you marry him as
this man says you did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I married him,&#8221; returned Sheila
dully, and Langford sank limply into his
chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span></p>
<p>Dakota smiled with flashing eyes and
continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Keegles married the woman,&#8221; he said
coldly, &#8220;because he thought she was Langford&#8217;s
real daughter.&#8221; He looked at Sheila
with a glance of compassion. &#8220;Later, when
Keegles discovered that the woman was only
Langford&#8217;s stepdaughter, he was mighty
sorry. Not for Langford, however, because
he could not consider Langford&#8217;s feelings.
And in spite of what he had done he was
still determined to secure revenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day Langford came to Keegles with
a proposal. He had seen Keegles kill one
man, and he wanted to hire him to kill another&mdash;a
man named Doubler. Keegles
agreed, for the purpose of getting Langford
into&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota hesitated, for Langford had risen
to his feet and stood looking at him, his eyes
bulging, his face livid.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he said, in a choking, wailing
voice; &#8220;you&mdash;you, are Ned Keegles! You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash; Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
he hesitated and
passed a hand uncertainly over his forehead,
looking from Sheila to Dakota with glazed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
eyes. &#8220;You&mdash;you are a liar!&#8221; he suddenly
screamed, his voice raised to a maniacal
pitch. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t so! You&mdash;both of you&mdash;have
conspired against me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Dakota got to his feet, walked
to a shelf, and took down a small glass, a
pair of shears, a shaving cup, and a razor.
While Langford watched, staring at him
with fearful, wondering eyes, Dakota deftly
snipped off the mustache with the shears,
lathered his lip, and shaved it clean. Then
he turned and confronted Langford.</p>
<p>The latter looked at him with one, long,
intense gaze, and then with a dry sob which
caught in his throat and seemed to choke
him, he covered his face with his hands,
shuddered convulsively, and without a
sound pitched forward, face down, at
Dakota&#8217;s feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>INTO THE UNKNOWN</h3>
</div>

<p>After a time Sheila rose from the
bunk on which she had been sitting
and stood in the center of the floor,
looking down at her father. Dakota had
not moved. He stood also, watching Langford,
his face pale and grim, and he did not
speak until Sheila had addressed him twice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221; she
said dully. &#8220;It is for you to say, you know.
You hold his life in your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; He smiled bitterly at her.
&#8220;What would you do? I have waited ten
years for this day. It must go on to the
end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The end?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the end,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;He&#8221;&mdash;Dakota
pointed to the prostrate figure&mdash;&#8220;must
sign a written confession.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will return to answer for his crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila shuddered and turned from him
with bowed head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said at last; &#8220;it will be too
horrible! My friends in the East&mdash;they
will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friends,&#8221; he said with some bitterness.
&#8220;Could your friends say more than
my friends said when they thought that I
had murdered my own father in cold blood
and then run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am innocent,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was innocent,&#8221; he returned, with a
grave smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I could not help you, you
know, for I wasn&#8217;t there when you were
accused. But you are here, and you can
help me. Don&#8217;t you see,&#8221; she said, coming
close to him, &#8220;don&#8217;t you see that the disgrace
will not fall on him, but on me. I
will make him sign the confession,&#8221; she offered,
&#8220;you can hold it over him. He will
make restitution of your property. But do
not force him to go back East. Let him
go somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;but let him live.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
For, after all, he is my father&mdash;the only one
I ever knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my vengeance,&#8221; he said, the bitterness
of his smile softening as he looked down
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your vengeance?&#8221; She came closer to
him, looking up into his face. &#8220;Are we to
judge&mdash;to condemn? Will not the power
which led us three together&mdash;the power
which you are pleased to call &#8216;Fate&#8217;; the
power that blazed the trail which you have
followed from the yesterday of your life;&mdash;will
not this power judge him&mdash;punish him?
Please,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;please, for my sake,
for&mdash;for&#8221;&mdash;her voice broke and she came
forward and placed her hands on his shoulders&mdash;&#8220;for
your wife&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down at her for an instant, the
hard lines of his face breaking into gentle,
sympathetic curves. Then his arms went
around her, and she leaned against him, her
head against his shoulder, while she wept
softly.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>An hour later, standing side by side in
the open doorway of the cabin, Sheila and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
Dakota watched in silence while Langford,
having signed a confession dictated by Dakota,
mounted his pony and rode slowly up
the river trail toward Lazette.</p>
<p>He slowly passed the timber clump near
the cabin, and with bowed head traveled up
the long slope which led to the rise upon
which, in another time, Sheila had caught
her last glimpse of the parson. It was in
the cold, bleak moment of the morning when
darkness has not yet gone and the dawn not
come, and Langford looked strangely desolate
out there on the trail alone&mdash;alone with
thoughts more desolate than his surroundings.</p>
<p>Sheila shivered and snuggled closer to
Dakota. He looked down at her with a
sympathetic smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so lonesome,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out there&mdash;where he is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dakota did not answer. For a long time
they watched the huddled form of the rider.
They saw him approach the crest of the rise&mdash;reach
it. Then from the mountains in the
eastern distance came a shaft of light, striking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
the summit of the rise where the rider
bestrode his pony&mdash;throwing both into bold
relief. For a moment the rider halted the
pony, turned, glanced back an instant, and
was gone.</p>
